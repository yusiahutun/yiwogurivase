Apple Music changed their policy the next day. &nbsp;</p><p id=e2SPwfx141BK data-wc=26>It took three years for Taylor to put <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>her music back on Spotify</a> and other streaming services, to celebrate selling over 100 million albums worldwide.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Taylor's Version&nbsp;</h2><p id=eYIQrRbcs6MF data-wc=50>Taylor's willingness to fight back against the system continued when she left Big Machine Records in 2019 and her albums were acquired by US entrepreneur Scooter Braun – meaning that he was in control of the majority of her work.

Photos of her cats and videos of the singer high on pain medication keep Taylor connected to Swifties everywhere: megastar and girl next door in equal measure. She's like Beyoncé and Adele rolled into one – the Taylor Swift paradox.</p><p id=eA3XVDAShdI2 data-wc=33>Add to this hybrid &nbsp;a splash of the business mind of Oprah Winfrey, who also features in Forbes' celebrity billionaires list, and it's no wonder we can't keep our eyes off Taylor Swift.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dac7a34751ba-gettyimages-2090221066.jpg><p id=ePNUU8kQN05- data-wc=48>Mark is quick to praise Taylor's business approach: "Primarily focusing on her music, her fans, and her savvy reclaiming of her master recordings, [she] is like a breath of fresh, non-commercialised air. It challenges the traditional narrative and reminds us that in the end, content still reigns supreme."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Team Taylor</h2><p id=eAjbpNnyj8zJ data-wc=93>In Kelly Clarkson's <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">original tweet</a>, she said: “I'd buy all of the new versions just to prove a point”, wise advice highlighting the pivotal role of her support network in Taylor's ascent to stardom. Indeed, while there's no 'I' in team there is a 'T', and Taylor's road to riches hasn't been travelled alone. From her parents supporting her as a child by moving to Nashville, to having the right people around her to advise on all aspects of mega stardom, 'team Taylor' has been a vital part of her career to date.&nbsp;</p><p id=eh81PZRt32kr data-wc=75>The importance of teamwork isn't lost on Jonathan Gold of London & Capital. "A vital part of achieving and then maintaining such levels of success are having the right team around you," Jonathan tells HELLO!. "Having a cohort of advisors that are experienced in managing talent through their growth phases is key. They can help navigate the commercial, legal and tax minefield, with a view to maintaining the star's brand appeal and preserving their wealth.”</p><h2 dir=ltr>The Eras Tour&nbsp;</h2><p id=e-RiFMdeKMlq data-wc=26>The most visual symbols of Taylor's ability to harness her songs, fans and family and team into an unstoppable, wealth-driving force of nature are her tours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ecaf902917f1-gettyimages-2053045580.jpg><p id=eztf-h1gHHY7 data-wc=31>The World Tour broke records when it grossed $181.5 million.

As well as income from touring and album sales, Taylor has an impressive portfolio of properties: a New York townhouse, a Rhode Island beach house, two properties in Nashville, including a penthouse, and two Beverly Hills estates. Property is widely viewed &nbsp;as the best investment, and so Taylor's involvement doesn't come as a surprise to Hargreaves Lansdown's Susannah Streeter. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/80784b260706-gettyimages-1234832589.jpg><p id=eDIkbjbLzYqK data-wc=30>"[Taylor's] a girl that likes to have funds.
