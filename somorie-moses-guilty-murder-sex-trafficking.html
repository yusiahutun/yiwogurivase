When one victim, identified at today’s guilty plea proceeding as Jane Doe 1, refused to engage in prostitution, Moses used a taser against her until she complied," read the press release. "Another victim, identified as Jane Doe 2, was slashed on her arms and back with a razor by Moses who also beat her with a belt before pouring lemon juice on her wounds, leaving her permanently scarred."</p><p>Per the release, Moses put a shotgun in the mouth of another victim and threatened to killer her child when she told him she "did not want to work as a prostitute."</p><p>"With today's guilty plea to every count in the indictment, Moses is held fully responsible for preying on women and girls, forcing them to become prostitutes, and then brutally murdering and dismembering one of his many victims," United States Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. "While the defendant's total admission of guilt cannot undo the terrible harm he has caused, we hope it will bring a measure of closure to his victims who suffered the defendant's extreme cruelty and brutality, and to the family of Ms. Foster."</p><p>"Today's guilty plea brings finality to a case of reprehensible sexual exploitation, brutal assault, and murder," added NYPD Commissioner Caban.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmanBfqLyuu9GinGaln6iytHnGrqClrKliura%2Bw56pZquVrXq1vsCfnaKbm567qHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruce-perreault-bio-wife-kids-height-parents-survivor-45.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Bruce Perreault!
