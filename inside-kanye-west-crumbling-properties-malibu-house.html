still has several crumbling properties, including <a href=#>a $53million beachside home</a> with no doors or windows, which he finally put on the market this month.</p><p>Kanye is known for having big ideas for his business empire and buying property only to abandon projects halfway through.</p><p>And the past year has been no different, as he left many places to rot when he packed up and headed off with his second wife, <a href=#>Bianca Censori</a>, this summer.</p><p>He has now been seen back in town with her spending time with his four children on Christmas Day at a Lakers game.</p><h2

a sought-after house by the sea in Malibu, designed by celebrated Japanese architect Tadao Ando.</p><p>He quickly got to work gutting the entire home's interior and allegedly made wild demands.</p><p>The U.S. Sun&nbsp;later <a href=#>obtained a copy</a>&nbsp;of a lawsuit filed by Tony Saxon, his former project manager, who is suing him in&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles</a>&nbsp;County Superior&nbsp;<a href=#>Court</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>In court docs, Saxton claimed he refused to remove all the windows and electricity in the home, but his employee "expressed concerns about the extreme danger of such actions."</p><p>The lawsuit, which is still ongoing, said <a href=#>Tony is suing Kanye</a> for multiple labor code violations, unpaid wages, and wrongful retaliatory termination.</p><p>Kanye's counsel recentlly filed a nine-page response to the complaint as Saxon claims he is owed $1million in unpaid wages and damages.</p><p>It reads: "Defendant denies generally and specifically each and every allegation contained in the complaint, and each and every purported cause of action contained in the complaint and specifically denies that Plaintiff has sustained any injury, damage, or loss by reason of any act, omission or breach by Defendant and denies that Plaintiff is entitled to any or all of the relief requested in the complaint."</p><p>Kanye has now decided to leave the home in its current state and <a href=#>put it on the market</a>, hiring famous real estate agent Jason Oppenheim who stars on the reality TV show <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a>.</p><p>But he's asking for about $4million less than what he paid for.</p><p>"It's priced to reflect the need for the interior finishes to be replaced. On the positive, it can be brought up to 2024 standards, it was built about 10 years ago," Jason said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>YEEZY HQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/shot-us-sun-exclusive-pics-860074622.jpg><p>In March of this year, Kanye quietly bought a 7,416-square-foot commercial&nbsp;<a href=#>building on Melrose Avenue</a>&nbsp;in West Hollywood, which was set to be a multi-purpose space for his fashion business.</p><p>He plunked down $6.7million and the deal was done through Oxpaha LLC, a Delaware firm incorporated the same month, according to deed documents.</p><p><a href=#>Bianca</a>, who was previously named&nbsp;<a href=#>special power of attorney</a>&nbsp;for another&nbsp;<a href=#>property</a>&nbsp;deal for her husband, is listed as the point of contact for the property.</p><p><a href=#>Kanye</a>&nbsp;set up a similar company - Ox Paha Inc - when he trademarked the word: "Yews," under some classifications from cosmetics to clothing.</p><p>But after painting all of the doors and windows grey, it has barely been used and was recently seen covered in graffiti while Ye was off recording his&nbsp;<a href=#>new album in Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>Sources claim the inside of the property is full of half-finished giant wooden structures, and only a few workers on sewing machines have been spotted at the building.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>LA RANCH</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kanye-wests-canyon-ranch-property-812601228-1.jpg><p>Kanye also owns a $6.2million property in the hills of Calabasas with 320 acres, where he used to hold his Sunday Service sessions some years ago.</p><p>He bought the home in 2018 and kept it after his divorce from ex Kim Kardashian, who lives nearby with their four children;
