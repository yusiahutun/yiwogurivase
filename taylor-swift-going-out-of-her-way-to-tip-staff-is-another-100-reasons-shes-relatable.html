The singer may be swimming in wealth from her chart-topping songs and record-breaking concerts, but she knows how to give back. Taylor Swift has gained more praise from fans after the recent tip she gave to staff at the Kansas City Chiefs game.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star has a good reputation, but what’s more important, she knows how to keep it. <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> knows how to show people she appreciates them, and her recent tip to works at a football stadium is showing her true colors. An employee has come forward to reveal their interaction and how much of a “sweetie pie” she really is.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-loves-giving-out-a-tip>Taylor Swift loves giving out a tip</h2><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> was at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park to watch her beau <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> play against the Buffalo Bills last week. She’s been seen at many Kansas City Chiefs games since their relationship became public, and fans have never been disappointed.</p><p>But it’s come out that she not only puts on a great show of support to Trav, but to the staff who work there as well.</p><p>Jerris Rainey, who works at the New York stadium, sang her praises.</p><p>“She’s a sweetie pie,” she told 7 News Buffalo the next day.</p><p>“Very down to Earth. I just wanted to just see her, and she stopped, and she asked me if I worked at the stadium.”</p><p>The fan’s conversation with Taylor Swift continued: “I said yes, and she asked if she could give me a tip. And she gave me $100, and then she asked if I wanted to take a picture with her, and I said yes.”</p><p>The 34-year-old cheered on boyfriend Travis – who <a href=#>apparently tackled Justin Timberlake</a> during a game of golf. It was all smiles for the athlete this weekend, though, as his team beat the Bills 27-24. When Trav scored a touchdown, he <a href=#>displayed a heart gesture to the crowd</a> – which some say was for Tay Tay. But he later clarified in his New Heights podcast with his brother, the <a href=#>gesture wasn’t actually for her</a>. Awkward.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-gave-away-millions-to-her-truck-drivers>Taylor gave away millions to her truck drivers</h2><p>It comes after the <a href=#>award show</a> winner handed out bonuses to her employees during the <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>. In the summer, news headlines were covered with reports the singer gave each of her truck drivers $100,000 bonuses for their hard work during the huge tour. The big tip would have set Taylor Swift back an extra $5 million.</p><p>Taylor’s presence at Trav’s games can cause a huge buzz. Some football fans are upset cameras from the game appear to cut back to the Lover singer instead of the game.</p><p>But last weekend, it was Travis’ brother Jason Kelce, that caught attention. He took his shirt off, jumped around, screamed and climbed into the stands after watching his brother score a touchdown.</p><p>Tay Tay wasn’t sure what to do, just watching in awe, but she later gave him a high-five celebrating Travis’ success.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aeqKGenHqwwdNmpp9lmJq%2FbsPAsmStp12ptrF50q2Yn55dnsBurc2oq6GdomJ%2BcXyMq5yaq5%2BjwG6%2Fx56qZqqVoa61rcGlnGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sodium-hyaluronate.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Sodium Hyaluronate and How Can It Benefit the Skin?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./doug-rasheed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Net Worth of Chaka Khans husband Doug Rasheed 2022; Personal life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
