"And that's not an actor thing to do."</p><p>"I think it was more like, I don't really do method acting, but I took a class in it when I was younger," she continued. "And I do think I do become a lot like the character, and I think he thought I was really like Sharpay. And it wasn't until we wrapped that he was like, 'Oh, you're not that person.' And I was like, 'Yeah.' But I was probably at first giving him line readings at the screen test, I was like, 'I want the last line, okay? So this is what I'm going to say.'"</p><p>"I was 18, but I wanted the job!" she added, laughing. "So, I mean, I got it!"</p><p>In addition to starring in the "HSM" films opposite <a href=#><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a>, Tisdale also had a recurring role on the Disney Channel series "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody," starring <a href=#><strong>Cole</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Dylan Sprouse</strong></a>.</p><p>During her "WWHL" appearance, a caller asked Tisdale to play a game of "Shag, Marry and Kill" with her former co-stars, Efron and the Sprouse twins.</p><p>"Are you kidding me? You picked twins and Zac?" she said. "This is so brutal, man."</p><p>Although Tisdale was clearly cringing, she didn't seem to have a hard time choosing her answers.</p><p>"I would shag Cole Sprouse," she said of the <a href=#><strong>"Riverdale"</strong></a> star. "Who would you kill?" <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> then asked and Tisdale replied with a laugh, "Zac Efron."</p><p>"And you would marry Dylan Sprouse?" Cohen asked. "Yes! He's such a good guy." Tisdale admitted.</p><p>Although the "Young and Hungry" star was pretty open to talk about her time on the Disney Channel, there was one fan question that she refused to answer.</p><p>"What is the wildest/craziest thing you've ever seen a Disney Channel co-star do?" a "WWHL" caller asked.</p><p>"Oh, I plead the fifth on that," Tisdale immediately replied. "I'm not going even there, ha ha! Not going there."</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
