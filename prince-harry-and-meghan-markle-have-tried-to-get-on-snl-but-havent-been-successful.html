Both <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and her husband were supposedly “in talks” with producers over having the big hosting gig and cameo appearances. However, it has never come to fruition, and it may be because of how often <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan have been the butt of the joke during Saturday Night Sketches, the commentator says.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-wanted-to-appear-on-snl>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry ‘wanted to appear on SNL’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Schofield said Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were meant to appear on SNL to promote their projects, but it didn’t end up happening. The pair have appeared on TV since moving to sunny California. Meghan featured on the Ellen DeGeneres show, where she drank from a baby’s bottle as a prank. And the Duke spoke to Britain James Corden on his former late night show.</p><p>Meghan, 42, was rumored to be pining for a hosting spot in early 2022 to promote her upcoming <a href=#>Spotify</a> podcast Archetypes. The former <a href=#>TV</a> star’s podcast featured her talking to big names such as Mariah Carey and Serena Williams about “investigating, dissecting, and subverting the labels that try to hold women back.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Harry was trying to get himself a cameo last year to promote his explosive memoir Spare, apparently. The book was explosive and detailed his life as a prince, as well as his life after meeting Meghan and stepping down from The Firm. The couple left the royal family in what was nicknamed ‘Megxit’ in January 2020 and moved across the pond. They now live in their <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> with their two children.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Meghan Markle returning to Hollywood with ‘Suits reunion isn’t going to happen’</a></p><p>“It was reported when Meghan was about to launch her podcast that she was trying to actually host SNL,” said Schofield.</p><p>“It was reported when Spare came out that Prince Harry was trying to have a little cameo on there.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-was-all-in-says-source>Harry was ‘all in’, says source</h2><p>Kinsey continued by saying it “makes you wonder if they’ve changed their mind” after being the butt of the joke in many sketches on the show, which started in December 2022.</p><p>On Harry’s possible SNL debut, a source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Page Six in February last year: “I know that Harry was all in, he was really serious about doing it – and it would have been great fun as promo for the book.</p><p>“SNL producers have been after Harry for a while. Everyone on the show was really into the idea, and people would definitely have tuned in.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-return-to-hollywood>Meghan’s return to Hollywood</h2><p>While Meghan Markle and Prince Harry aren’t above hosting SNL, Schofield recently told Sky Australia the former <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star thinks a Suits reboot is “beneath her.” The new series, which is said to have been green-lit already, could see Meghan return to her acting roots and trying her hand at directing.</p><p>Schofield, who hosts the To Di For podcast, said: “It is being reported that in this new Suits spin-off, there’s a character that’s cut for her specifically to a T. However, I would argue that we did not see Meghan reunite with the cast of Suits as the <a href=#>Golden Globes</a> a few weeks ago.</p><p>“[It] would have been a strong, independent statement reminding the world that she was somebody before she married Harry, and she opted not to do that. I believe, socially, she thinks <a href=#>she’s risen to a much higher level</a> than fourth on the Suits call sheet.”</p><p>Meghan starred in the original series, which ran for nine seasons from 2011 until 2018. Meghan left the acting world to marry Harry, whom she met through <a href=#>Instagram</a> in 2016.</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit and GRV Media have approached Harry and Meghan’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Harry and Meghan pose with ‘TV bosses’ weeks after rumors of Duchess’ ‘Hollywood comeback’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WEcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZKaZoqC5pnnHmq2eZaSntqawjK2mZp%2BVqXqwuoyspaVlkqrBbrTAr5ynrF2Xsqa6jKysnJuVqMCnwcto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./19-facts-about-oman-air.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>19 Facts About Oman Air</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./641c9a4b22601d93798b4603-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mxico Femenil revela jersey si hubieran ido al Mundial: Inspirado en un tiburn ballena!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
