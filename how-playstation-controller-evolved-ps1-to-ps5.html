The unique shape and ergonomic design of the PlayStation joypad have cemented it as one of the most iconic controllers in the history of gaming.</p><p>So, in this article, we take a look at all of the PlayStation controllers released to date, including the new PlayStation 5 controller. Join us for a trawl through gaming history as we chart the evolution of the PlayStation controller from the PS1 through to the PS5.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-has-remained-constant-over-time>What Has Remained Constant Over Time?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/playstation-controller-buttons.jpg><p>There are a number of features shared by all of the PlayStation control pads. We have the configuration of the action buttons and their well-known geometric labels; a green triangle, a red circle, a blue cross, and a green square.</p><p>The&nbsp;action buttons have always been on the right-hand side of the controller. The left-hand side features the directional buttons, and the top of the pad features two shoulder buttons on either side. The space between the D-pad and action buttons always contains&nbsp;the <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>Select</strong> buttons.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Of course, we also have the grip handles. These have hardly changed over time,&nbsp;and remain one of the things that make the PlayStation control pad so recognizable. They are designed to make the pad easier and more comfortable to hold.</p><h2 id=the-original-playstation-controller-1994>The Original PlayStation Controller (1994)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Playstation-Controller.jpg><p>The first iteration of the&nbsp;interface was known, simply, as the PlayStation Controller. It came in PlayStation Gray, matching the color of the original console. It was configured as described in the section above, with a Sony PlayStation logo sat above the Start and Select buttons.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The first PlayStation Controller differs from its successors in that it is the only pad not to have thumbsticks. It was also a wired controller, which plugged into the front of the PlayStation into a specially designed controller port; a feature ditched in later permutations of the joypad.</p><p>This controller went through one or two variations of its own, with an increase in its dimensions and the length of its wire being two of the improvements Sony made.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=the-dual-analog-controller-1997>The Dual Analog Controller (1997)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dula-analog.png><p>This was a pretty short-lived successor to the PlayStation Controller, but it paved the way for great things in future generations of the interface. In 1997, the Dual Analog Controller added thumbsticks into the equation, which have remained an integral part of the PlayStation's controls ever since.</p><p>These analog sticks were used, as you may expect, to play analog-compatible games. You could switch between using the D-pad on its own (Digital mode), using the analog sticks (Analog mode), or emulating the PlayStation Analog Joystick (Analog Flightstick Mode).</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Cycling through was achieved by pressing the newly-added Analog button, located centrally below both the Start and Select buttons, between the thumbsticks. The Dual Analog was discontinued in 1998 due to its lack of vibration function.</p><p>It is possible to differentiate the&nbsp;Dual Analog from&nbsp;the successor (the DualShock) because its analog sticks don't have rubber grips on the top. Instead, they have a recess to cup your thumb.</p><h2 id=the-dualshock-controller-1998>The DualShock Controller (1998)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualshock-1.png><p>The DualShock has gone through numerous changes, in terms of its form and function, and even the stylization of its name.</p><p>With analog sticks now a firm favorite among PlayStation fans, they were here to stay with the first DualShock. However, they now also incorporated two more action buttons; depressing the thumbsticks until they clicked performs the L3 (left) and R3 (right) actions in a game.</p><p>This was the first of the PlayStation controllers to&nbsp;boast vibration feedback (it was stenciled in for the poor old Dual Analog before that feature was shelved outside of Japan). Like its two predecessors, it was a wired control pad and was released for the original PlayStation, in a matching gray color.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The DualShock had longer grips than the canned Dual Analog. These contained the vibration motors which give the DualShock its rumble, which occurs in response to on-screen events.</p><p>While compatible with the PS2, it did not work with some of the games (although it did work with backward-compatible PS1 games).</p><h2 id=the-dualshock-2-controller-2000>The DualShock 2 Controller (2000)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualshock-2.png><p>Things started to change with the introduction of the DualShock 2. Firstly, it was released in conjunction with Sony's second console, the PlayStation 2. Aside from that, it has very little to write home about in terms of differences from its predecessor.</p><p>It was, however, the first PlayStation controller to&nbsp;deviate in terms of default colorway. The DualShock 2 came in a sleek black, making it look that little bit cooler in the process. Of course, previous models had been released in various see-through plastics and such, but the basic versions were always gray.</p><p>Again, it was wired, and again it had the same Start, Select, and Analog button configuration as&nbsp;the two PlayStation controllers that came before it. However, it did add analog functionality to the action buttons, making them pressure sensitive.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=the-sixaxis-controller-2006>The Sixaxis Controller (2006)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sixaxis_ps3_controller.jpg><p>Sony briefly dropped the DualShock nomenclature when it released the PS3. With it, the company bundled its newest and best controller yet; the Sixaxis. Best, why? Because it was wireless, of course!</p><p>This was the first time gamers hadn't required a wired connection to their PlayStation.&nbsp;With this, it brings&nbsp;its own problems, though,&nbsp;such as your controller running out of juice during a crucial moment on Battlefield. You could connect it with a micro-USB&nbsp;to&nbsp;USB cable, now the favored charging lead for Sony.</p><p>The Sixaxis was also motion-sensitive. This meant that you could control certain elements of a game (such as balancing on a log in&nbsp;Uncharted, for example) simply by tilting the pad. Because of this, it didn't vibrate. Clearly, Sony hadn't learned its lesson from the Dual Analog. It did drop the Analog button, though.</p><p>In its place was the home button, denoted by the PlayStation symbol. This is used to exit a game and head back to the PlayStation home screen.</p><h2 id=the-dualshock-3-controller-2007>The DualShock 3 Controller (2007)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualshock-3-controller.png><p>Realizing (again) that rumbling joypads were important to gamers, Sony backpedaled and introduced the DualShock 3 for the PS3. This was almost exactly the same as the Sixaxis in every way, save for the introduction of Force Feedback and the words DualShock at the top.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Force Feedback was Sony's version of haptic feedback which had been seen with the DualShock 2. Its controls, wireless capabilities, and micro-USB to USB charging all remained the same.</p><p>The DualShock&nbsp;3 also retained the motion sensitivity present with the Sixaxis. At last, Sony was onto a winner and had discovered the perfect balance between control and interaction.</p><h2 id=the-dualshock-4-controller-2013>The DualShock 4 Controller (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dualshock-4-controller.png><p>The DualShock 4 was released alongside the PlayStation 4. This was similar to the DualShock 3, but with several major differences. Its general controls remained the same, with analog sticks still present. It also carried forward the motion-sensing tech and haptic feedback of its former versions.</p><p>The first major difference is the capacitive touchpad which dominates the front center of the pad. This is capable of responding to two simultaneous touches, as well as taking&nbsp;on various button functions (the controller remaps to use the touchpad as the Start and Select buttons when playing <a href=#>PlayStation Now games</a>).</p><p>The second major difference is the light bar at the top, which glows in response to certain conditions, such as when the controller is charging or switched on. It also represents different players on the same console with a different color. This also works with <a href=#>the PlayStation Camera</a>, telling the device where the controller is located.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You also get a headset jack capable of delivering stereo sound. You can plug any 3.5mm wired headphones or headset into the DualShock 4 controller and use them to listen to the game rather than your home theater system.</p><p>The Extension port is also a new feature with the DualShock 4, allowing for connection with different headsets, chargers, and a miniature keyboard that attaches to the PS4 controller.</p><p>Finally, you had the addition of the Options and Share buttons. These opened different menus on the PS4. Options, as you might expect, opens an options menu. The Share button opens up a collection of tools to help with sharing your gameplay, be that through streaming or via screenshots.</p><h2 id=the-dualsense-controller-2020>The DualSense Controller (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DualSense-PS5-Controller.png><p>And so we arrive at the DualSense controller. This is the PlayStation controller that ships with the PlayStation 5. The first thing that you will notice about the pad is the colorway; two-tone white and black to match the console.</p><p>The form factor remains fairly similar to the DualShock 4 (you can still <a href=#>use a PS4 controller on a PS5</a> in some circumstances). The shape has changed slightly, but not very much. One nice cosmetic addition is the blue backlighting for the capacitive touchpad.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The DualSense also features a Create button in place of the former model's Share button. Players&nbsp;are also able to communicate with other players just by using the DualSense's internal mic, independent of headphones.</p><p>The DualSense also makes use of a USB Type-C (<a href=#>what is USB Type-C?</a>) input for charging, removing the outdated micro-USB of the DualShock 3 onwards.</p><h2 id=the-history-of-the-playstation-controller>The History of the PlayStation Controller</h2><p>There we have it. Five generations of PlayStation controllers have brought joy and excitement to people all over the world and, hopefully, Sony doesn't plan on stopping any time soon. For now, we can all enjoy getting to grips with the PlayStation 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dpbmixdKtmK2hn6N6pLvNramopJyav26x1aijr52UYr20fYytpmaoo2p8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-action-bronson-daughter-her-name-and-age-revealed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Action Bronson Daughter?
