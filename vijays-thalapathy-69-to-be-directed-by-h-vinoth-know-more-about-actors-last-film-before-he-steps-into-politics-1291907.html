The report further claimed that the filmmaker has conducted a script reading session for Thalapathy Vijay, which has made him excited to take on his upcoming project. However, if we look at the works of H Vinoth, they have mostly been based on politics, where a protagonist stands for justice against wrong-doers. So it can be a compelling move for Thalapathy to sign the director for his last project.
