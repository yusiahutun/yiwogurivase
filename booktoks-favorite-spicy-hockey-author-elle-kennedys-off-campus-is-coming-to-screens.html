Off Campus began with the 2015 book The Deal,&nbsp;which in recent years has become a TikTok sensation thanks to the explosion of interest in hockey romance books. "I am allowed to give you a little scoop about [this], there is something in development at the moment for Off Campus.... I'm excited!" Elle told<strong>&nbsp;HELLO!</strong></p><p id=eJ4BuvEJ__X data-wc=71>"I think there's always lots of things behind the scenes happening and that's the case for most authors; you have to sit on things and not say anything," she added. "Then everyone asks, "Do you want to make it into a movie? Do you want to make it into a TV show?" And of course I do. But it's a matter of finding someone who wants to make it as well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f98d7ca68f62-off-campus.jpg><p id=eCR9HsrcNIV data-wc=87>The Deal&nbsp;is a spicy romance that follows Briar University student Hannah Wells who, although she may be confident in every other area of her life, is "carting around a full set of baggage when it comes to sex and seduction". But when she asks her college's cocky hockey captain Garrett Graham to help her land a date with her crush she is forced to accept his deal to tutor him in exchange for his help – and neither of them is prepared for what happens next.&nbsp;</p><p id=ergLdAd-Lm data-wc=42>The Deal led to three sequels – The Mistake, The Score, The Goal&nbsp;– all of which followed various members of Garrett's team, and&nbsp;The Legacy, which featured four short novellas focusing on each of the main characters from the first books.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKHoT23gfP data-wc=49>Details of which company picked up the series are closely guarded, but our bets are on this becoming a TV show as the series itself is in development, and <strong data-gid=e9UTmU3Ku6G>with a rich carousel of characters to pull from, there is scope for a sexy ensemble series if handled correctly.</strong></p><p id=edHV_wqY6wJ><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eXHOcVJTKB data-wc=47>Elle has now released&nbsp;The Graham Effect, her first next-generation book that follows Hannah and Garrett's daughter Gigi as she attends their alma mater, Briar University. But the decision to launch a new series based on the children of her characters, was never in the original plan.&nbsp;</p><p id=eTH6o7S7i_3 data-wc=32>"Next generation books are hit or miss for me; most of the time I'm disappointed – the characters aren't doing what my imagination created after the other books ended," Elle tells <strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eeSgX3-oYP data-wc=93>"But I made a mistake in writing a novella anthology with other authors and there was a little cute story about Garrett and Hannah (from The Deal) – they get trapped in the snow – and I had hundreds of emails from readers saying, ''I need to see a novella for every single book in the off-campus series.' So I wrote The Legacy, and made the mistake of giving Garrett and Hannah twins and suddenly I'm getting hundreds of emails: 'Oh, I want to see what Garrett and Hannah's twins would be like.'&nbsp;</p><p id=ee9F3Muyit data-wc=33>"I really was not planning on writing a book for them.
