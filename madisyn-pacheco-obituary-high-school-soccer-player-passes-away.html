She joined the company on July 20, 2023.</p><p>On November 15, the East Bay Fish Company gave an update about Madisyn’s health on their <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook page</a>. They wrote that Madisyn was transported to Rhode Island Hospital Medical Intensive Care Unit from Newport Hospital.</p><p>On inspection, they found out Madisyn had a brain infection and was being closely monitored by the medical staff. The Facebook page also wrote that the doctors said the infection spreads really quickly and it takes more time to get better.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Madisyn might not have responded well to the treatment, which led to her demise. On her Facebook page and the Facebook page of East Bay Fish Company, Erica shared a post confirming Madisyn had passed away.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/madisyn-pacheco-family.jpg><p>Erica wrote, “It is with GREAT sadness today at 4:51 pm, our BEAUTIFUL AMAZING DAUGHTER passed away peacefully in my arms, surrounded by her father and loved ones.”</p><p>She further wrote, “I lost my best friend, my baby girl, but I gained a beautiful guardian angel. She truly left a mark on this world and will never be forgotten!!”</p><p>Madisyn also has two brothers, who were seen with her in the 17th-anniversary pictures shared by her mom, Erica. They are believed to be Madisyn’s half brothers, with Erica having been married for the second time to Louie Pacheco.</p><h2>Tributes Pour In For Madisyn Pacheco</h2><p>Mt.

A couple of Madisyn’s close friends also wrote emotional posts talking about the time they spent together.</p><p>Lynsey Medeiros and Olivia Parente shared a photo of them holding Madisyn’s hand for one last time on their Facebook handle.
