Keep reading for what to know about Theresa.</p><p>Theresa Nist is one of 22 contestants on the first season of The Golden Bachelor, a spin-off of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelorette</a> featuring single men and women aged 60 and older. “Some of the casting interviews we got, they were just so touching,” ABC unscripted executive Rob Mill told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Variety</a> in 2020 about why the network wanted to create The Golden Bachelor. “It’s such a different way of doing The Bachelor because these people are just at a totally different place in their lives. There is an interesting thing about people who have hit the other end of the spectrum, who’ve lived their lives, they’ve raised their kids, some have been widowed or divorced and maybe some have never been in love. We thought that would be an interesting dynamic through the Bachelor prism.”</p><p>Gerry Turner, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Indiana, was announced as the Season 1 Golden Bachelor on Good Morning America in July 2023. “It’s never too late to fall in love again,” he said.&nbsp;Gerry is a father, grandfather, and widower. He married his wife and high school sweetheart, Toni, in 1974. They share two daughters, Angie and Jenny, and two granddaughters, Charlee and Payton. Gerry and Toni were married for 43 years until her death from an illness in 2017, six weeks after her retirement. “She got robbed,” Gerry told Good Morning America about Toni. “Every day that goes by, that’s the thought I have.”</p><p>When asked what Toni would think of him starring on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Golden Bachelor</a>, Gerry told Good Morning America that he believed his late wife would be “rooting” for him. “I have her picture on a dresser in my closet,” he said. “Every morning I give her the nod, ‘So what do you think about this?’ For a while it was like I was having a hard time figuring out if she would be OK. But we always told each other, when one of us goes, we want the other one to be happy.” He continued, “She’s saying, ‘Yeah Gerry, do this.’”</p><p>But back to Theresa on The Golden Bachelor. So who is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Theresa from The Golden Bachelor</a> and does she end up with Gerry?

The answer is unclear, but it seems like no. Theresa is one of two finalists on The Golden Bachelor Season 1, along with Leslie Fhima, a 64-year-old Fitness Instructor from Golden Valley, Minnesota, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>Reality Steve hasn’t confirmed Gerry’s winner on The Golden Bachelor Season 1 yet. However, fans speculate that Gerry didn’t pick Theresa and picked Leslie based on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TikTok video</a> Leslie posted in September 2023 of her and her granddaugther, Kiki, dancing, which fans believed Gerry recorded. “Whoever is filming starts to laugh and it weirdly sounds like Gerry’s laugh,” a Reddit user wrote. “I think he ends up with Leslie just from that video… that’s my guess!” Another commented on Leslie’s Instagram, “Ummm did I hear a tiny Gerry laugh from behind the camera?”</p><p>Fans also suspected that Gerry chose Leslie based on a video interview Gerry did with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>, which showed a woman in a mirror behind Gerry that looked like Leslie. “From the hair color, I think it’s Leslie,” a user commented on a video of TikTok account @<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ShesAllBach’s</a> repost of the video.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqbWmvsSsmGafn6GxprqMm5icoJWhvLN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-kanye-west-true-love.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kanye West calls relationship with Kim Kardashian true love</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-crosby-planned-call-apologize-former-bandmate-graham-nash-just-death-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Crosby planned to call and apologize to former bandmate Graham Nash just before his death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
