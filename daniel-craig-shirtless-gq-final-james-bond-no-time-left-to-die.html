It was genuinely like, my life is going to get f--ked if I do this," Craig told GQ of his initial thoughts when first offered the role that has since defined his career. "It was literally like, 'F--k off. I don't f--king want this. How dare you? How dare you offer this to me? It's just ludicrous. But it was all self defense."</p><p>After starring in four successful Bond films -- "Casino Royale" (2006), "Quantum of Solace" (2008), "Skyfall" (2012), and "Spectre" (2015) -- Craig almost walked away from the franchise, saying he felt "physically really low."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/45/o/2020/03/09/451a0294db925e56a19412a544184da3_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Lachlan Bailey/GQ</span><p>"I was never going to do one again," Craig admitted. "I was like, 'Is this work really genuinely worth this, to go through this, this whole thing?' And I didn't feel...I felt physically really low. So the prospect of doing another movie was just like, it was off the cards. And that's why it has been five years."</p><p>Craig, who redefined the role of 007, spoke about how he developed Bond's psyche.</p><p>"He is really f--king dark. I think it's more interesting," the actor explained. "I know we can't have him having amphetamines and speed and doing all these things. But inside, I know I'm doing that. And I wanted to inform the part and say that's what he is. He's kind of a f--k-up. Because this job would f--k you up."</p><p>"The biggest ideas are the best," he added. "And the biggest ideas are love and tragedy and loss. They just are, and that's what I instinctively want to aim for."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3ac2fdf3-7760-508d-b84d-a47b27ad011f data-container-ref=toofab:article:fe7b8171-89e7-58b3-9990-331cafd1fe8e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cc/5by4/2020/03/04/ccdfaaea77a15c599552f4f465cbfe14_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MGM</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New James Bond Film Delayed Until November Following Coronavirus Outbreak</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Although his time as Bond has come to an end, Craig expressed that he's looking forward to what's next.</p><p>"I'm really...I'm okay," he said. "I don't think I would have been if I'd done the last film and that had been it. But this, I'm like...Let's go. Let's get on with it. I'm fine."</p><p>"No Time Left to Die," which also stars <a href=#><strong>Rami Malek</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ana de Armas</strong></a>, was originally set to be released in April -- which Craig's GQ cover seemed to coincide with -- but now <a href=#><strong>won't hit theaters until November</strong></a> due to the <a href=#><strong>coronavirus</strong></a> outbreak.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
