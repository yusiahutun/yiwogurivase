You can find a device to keep your company in all scenarios, producing images that could pass as professional.</p><p>When getting ready to upgrade your camera, you’ll probably have come across the term “weather-sealed”. These cameras tend to be more expensive than models without weather sealing, but what are they? Why do you need one? Let’s find out.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-does-weather-sealed-mean>What Does Weather-Sealed Mean?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Photographer-Against-Tree.jpg><p>In its simplest form, weather sealing means that your camera has additional protection from the elements. The level of weather sealing will depend on your model and the brand it belongs to.</p><p>Weather-sealed cameras will often utilize materials that offer additional protection from the elements, such as rubber. In addition to weather-sealed camera bodies, you can also purchase lenses with this feature. For example, <a href=#>many prime lenses</a> come with weather sealing.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-are-weather-sealed-cameras-useful-for>What Are Weather-Sealed Cameras Useful For?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Photographer-With-Camera-at-Face.jpg><p>Weather-sealed cameras can help provide extra peace of mind, and they’re helpful in a wide variety of settings. We’ve listed some of the scenarios for which you should consider using one below.</p><h3 id=keeping-out-foreign-objects>Keeping Out Foreign Objects</h3><p>When you take photos outdoors, it’s not only the temperature and conditions you need to consider. You must also think about the potential extra risks that the weather can pose for your camera—for example, photography on a beach can result in sand or dust getting into your device.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you take photos in stormy weather, you might find that small bits of debris get into your camera. These can result in spots appearing; while you can quickly fix this in Adobe Lightroom, it’s a significant inconvenience to do so.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Adobe Lightroom and What Is It Used For?</a></span></p><p>Weather-sealed cameras provide a little extra protection against unwanted objects getting into your device, helping you get better pictures without worrying about the impact on your camera.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=taking-photos-in-the-rain>Taking Photos in the Rain</h3><p>Often, the weather that others perceive as “bad” is when you can get the best images. Rainy weather is one such example.</p><p>When you take photos in the rain, it’s needless to say that these conditions pose significant risks to your camera. Besides condensation, your camera and lenses can suffer from water damage—especially if you’re out in a torrential downpour.</p><p>Weather-sealed cameras can offer extra durability, enabling you to spend longer in the rain than would be the case with a non-weather-sealed camera.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=shooting-in-extreme-cold>Shooting in Extreme Cold</h3><p>Most DSLRs and mirrorless cameras are pretty durable, even in temperatures that many of us would consider “extreme”. Generally speaking, you shouldn’t have too many issues taking photos between -10ºC (14ºF) and +40ºC (104ºC).</p><p>If you go out when it’s lower than -10ºC, you might be able to use a non-weather-sealed camera. However, there are no guarantees that your device will work properly—or that you won’t cause long-lasting damage.</p><p>Weather-sealed cameras offer a little extra protection against cold temperatures, meaning that the conditions shouldn’t stop your camera from working in the way it’s meant to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Creative Photography Ideas for Beginners to Improve Their Skills</a></span></p><h2 id=what-rsquo-s-the-most-common-misconception-surrounding-weather-sealed-cameras>What’s the Most Common Misconception Surrounding Weather-Sealed Cameras?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Photographer-With-Camera-in-Hand.jpg><p>When you buy a weather-sealed camera, it’s important to remember that “sealed” does not mean “proof”. Your camera will probably still get water damage if you use it in a downpour for long enough, and you shouldn’t try underwater photography with it either—unless that was what it was designed for.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Even if you use a weather-sealed device, particles and debris can still get into your camera. So, you should still be careful about the conditions you shoot in—and it’s also worth cleaning out its insides each time you’re finished.</p><p>To provide additional protection in extreme weather, consider the following in addition to weather sealing:</p><ul><li>Use a rain cover for your camera.</li><li>Slowly transition your camera from hot to cold environments to avoid condensation.</li><li>Bring extra batteries if you’re shooting in extreme cold.</li></ul><h2 id=a-weather-sealed-camera-is-a-good-idea-if-you-rsquo-re-shooting-in-difficult-conditions>A Weather-Sealed Camera Is a Good Idea if You’re Shooting in Difficult Conditions</h2><p>Weather sealing isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to ending your camera-related worries in challenging conditions. However, having a device with this offers at least a little protection against the elements.</p><p>Weather-sealed cameras are typically more durable than those that aren’t. You can use them in various scenarios at both the hot and cold ends of the temperature spectrum.</p><p>When buying a weather-sealed camera, remember that different devices have different levels of protection. It’s wise to do a little extra research to ensure that the camera you buy meets your photography needs.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiunpmknbKzedKemKWdlGKwornEq5isZaedxm66xJ6bZqeemnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./las-vegas-performer-danny-gans-dies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Las Vegas Performer Danny Gans Dies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./saira-khan-reveals-mother-didnt-speak-eight-months-posed-naked-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Saira Khan reveals her mother didn't speak to her for EIGHT MONTHS after she posed naked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
