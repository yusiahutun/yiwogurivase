"And my dad was like, I'm not putting that on TV for everyone to see."</p><p>According to Savannah, there's this pressure in the South to display a "perfect" family picture at all times, which also weighed into Todd's hesitation. Obviously, he turned around on his stance, setting the stage for the family's long-running series.</p><p>Chrisley Knows Best ran from March 2014 to March 2023, and may have continued longer had Todd and wife <a href=#><strong>Julie</strong></a> not been found guilty of tax and bank fraud and been sentenced to prison.

At that point, Todd shared custody with Chloe's mother, Angela. In 2016, though, Angela was arrested for allegedly attempting to defraud Medicaid and food stamps, leaving Todd with sole custody.</p><p>Kyle got into trouble again in March 2023 after he was arrested for aggravated assault and released after posting $3,000 bond, per <a href=#><strong>TMZ</strong></a>. He reportedly brandished a "fixed blade" in the altercation, but wife Ashleigh told <a href=#><strong>Page Six</strong></a> that while he has a knife he carries for work, "he did not pull it out or brandish it, nor did he use it on the person." His case is still pending.</p><p>Savannah had also starred in Growing Up Chrisley (2019-2023), a spinoff series focused on her and her older brother <a href=#><strong>Chase</strong></a>. It was also put on hiatus when their parents were sentenced to prison. With both parents imprisoned, though, Savannah says there's a new project in the works.</p><p>According to Savannah on her <a href=#><strong>Unlocked</strong></a> podcast, fans will get to see how the family is dealing with "having two parents that are incarcerated.</p><p>"You're gonna see how my grandparents are dealing with things, how Chase and I are dealing with things," she said.
