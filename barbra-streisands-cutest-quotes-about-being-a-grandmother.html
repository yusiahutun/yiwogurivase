These days, the Funny Girl star is occupied with being the best grandma to her four grandchildren: Trevor, Eden, Westlyn and Chapel.</p><p>Barbra is the doting grandma of her youngest generation through stepson <a href=#><strong>Josh Brolin</strong></a>. The Goonies star shares his older <a href=#>children</a>, Trevor and Eden, with his first wife, <strong>Alice Adair,</strong> as well as his younger daughters, <a href=#>Westlyn</a> and Chapel, with his second spouse, <a href=#><strong>Kathryn Boyd Brolin</strong></a>.</p><p>Considering Josh’s older kids are adults, Barbra is having the best time watching Westlyn and Chapel grow up before her very eyes. When the Deadpool 2 star welcomed Westlyn in November 2018, the <a href=#>Star Is Born</a> alum was thrilled to have a new little one in her life.</p><p>“<a href=#>She spoils the baby completely</a>,” an insider exclusively told Closer in May 2019. “She buys gifts online from all over the world. It’s kind of out of control, but cute. She loves babies, and she treasures Westlyn.”</p><p>To honor the exciting chapter in Barbra’s life, Josh revealed he and his wife gifted the “No More Tears” singer with a touching memento. “My wife got Barbra a bracelet that said ‘Grandma’ on it and she started crying,” he told <a href=#>People</a> in June 2018. “She is really into it, and I love that she is into it. I mean, it’s like a very typical Jewish grandmother who is saturated by this event. It’s awesome.”</p><p>Barbra’s love for grandparenthood skyrocketed tenfold when Josh and Kathryn announced they welcomed their second child together and the actor’s fourth. Revealing the news of baby No. 4’s arrival, Josh said their daughter Chapel was born on December 25, 2020. “Our little Christmas evening angel,” he gushed on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>The Mirror Has Two Faces actress is certainly relishing her role as a grandma of four considering she’s “just mush” whenever she’s around them. Speaking with Closer in August 2020, Barbra’s hubby, James, offered an idea of how much being a grandparent truly means to his spouse.</p><p>“Barbra, by the way, these are not her blood grandchildren and <a href=#>she is just mush</a>,” the Sweet Tooth star exclusively shared. “She just turns to melted putty the minute … they talk on the phone. They send videos every other day of what the kid is doing. So we’re all very close.”</p><p>James also chatted about his latest little one, revealing the couple was “jumping” for joy when Josh and Kathryn told them they were having another baby. “When they found out it was another girl and [they] told us, we just were jumping up and down,” he gushed, adding they can’t get enough of their “darling” granddaughter Westlyn. “You get another one like this one, there couldn’t be anything better!” James marveled.</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see Barbra’s cutest quotes about being a grandmother!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bmKuaopZ6tMDRnqCsmZ6ZwG6v1K2crKxdpsKwwMSsZJqan6rBbq7EoqWgZZFitLOtzZ2kqKyYmr9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./capitol-music-group-names-six-new-vps-within-marketing-department.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Capitol Music Group Names Six New VPs Within Marketing Department</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./homemade-lip-scrub-8549945.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5 Homemade Lip Scrubs to Soften and Smooth Your Pout</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
