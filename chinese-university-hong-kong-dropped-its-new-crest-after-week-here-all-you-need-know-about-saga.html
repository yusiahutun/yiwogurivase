The second oldest university in the city also held an exhibition on the “Evolution of CUHK’s Emblem” on campuses but it was suspended after the emblem controversy erupted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/26/7882720e-719c-4366-b832-ddb118f15957_77a123d8.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2. What does the new design look like?</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The now-shelved emblem featured a golden phoenix on a purple background. The redesign retained the colours and symbol of the old version, but no longer halved the shield to apply the purple and gold in a reversed format.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new crest also came with a “simplified version” for use on social media platforms, which removed the university’s motto written in four Chinese characters that stated: “Through learning and temperance to virtue.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/26/7a7faa30-5938-43f1-9431-7fc7505b811d_45c74ec3.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">3. What happened after CUHK launched its new design?</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After CUHK unveiled the new crest, it immediately drew criticism from all three lawmakers who are also university council members, former city leader Leung Chun-ying, alumni and students. The beleaguered institution could hardly get any positive comments from anyone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawmaker and CUHK council member Edward Lau Kwok-fan slammed the university for being disrespectful because it did not conduct any consultations, saying changing the emblem would hit a nerve for many people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawmaker Tommy Cheung Yu-yan accused the university’s management of a lack of transparency over the change, adding that they were “treating us as if we are dead”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese University of Hong Kong head agrees to drop crest redesign after complaints</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another lawmaker Bill Tang Ka-piu said he found out about the new emblem on the same day it was announced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tuan’s long-time critic, former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying, also weighed in, pointing his finger at Tuan and accusing him of treating the institution as if it were his own.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Joint College Student Union Working Group, a platform organising the new student union, hit out at the management for a lack of consultation and destroying tradition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some internet users even said the new phoenix looked like a pheasant and slammed the university for being ungrateful as it removed the ribbon with the school motto.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">4.

Why is the issue so contentious?</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two analysts said the university did not understand and underestimated what the emblem meant to students and alumni and attributed the backlash to a lack of consultation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Chinese University political scientist Ma Ngok said the lawmakers asking for the independent inquiry overreacted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is indeed a procedural problem, but is it really a big deal that we need an independent investigation?

There must be sufficient reasons for redesigning a logo but marking the 60th anniversary is not a good reason,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">6. How has Rocky Tuan been challenged since having his term renewed?</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In April, CUHK governing council resolved that Tuan would be reappointed for three years commencing January 1, 2024, while it was widely reported that three lawmakers in the council opposed the resolution.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Is Rocky Tuan a patriot?
