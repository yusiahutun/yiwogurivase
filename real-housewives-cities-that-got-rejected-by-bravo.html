While it may seem like there are too many "Housewives" series to count, each group of gal pals have their own unique qualities that make them stand out.</p><p>And it turns out that through the years, there have been even more shows in other cities that just didn't work. According to executive producer <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a>, there are at least five shows that never came to fruition because they couldn’t find the right group of women.</p><p>"You look for a group of friends. Producers bring in casting people, and they find women who are on the society pages and belong to country clubs. 'Who are your friends, and how do you know each other?'" Andy <a href=#>explained</a>. "In the end, you kind of wind up with a reel of maybe 10 women who have some connections with each other. There's a little diagram that you look at…There have been a lot of places that we've tried but just didn't work."</p><p>Here are the cities that didn’t make the cut…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a31c4708-b1fc-4170-9a31-2b54a3bef497 data-container-ref=toofab:article:466db8f9-95f4-4650-a35f-ae4df3468778 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/da/5by4/2023/03/31/dabf28190a0d419eae2077ee9b28e1e6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brandi Glanville Says Alleged Caroline Manzo RHUGT Incident Felt 'Like a F---ing Set Up'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. Greenwich, Connecticut</strong></p><p>Andy Cohen says that at one point, Greenwich, Connecticut was considered for its own "Real Housewives" series. Although he didn’t specify why the show didn’t pan out, it could be due to the area’s proximity to New York City, New Jersey and Maryland. Considering several of the Housewives, like Bethenny Frankel, have owned homes in Connecticut, the cast could have been too closely intertwined.</p><p>"They have their own identity," Andy shared. "You know, it's funny, they're the same kind of format, if you want to call it a 'format,' but they all feel completely different, like really different ecosystems in every city. And so, that's really important."</p><p><strong>2. San Francisco, California</strong></p><p>San Francisco was also once a consideration for a "Real Housewives" show, which makes sense considering it has one of the <a href=#>highest billionaire populations in the world</a>. The city even <a href=#>reportedly</a> had a casting call, which specifically mentioned a search for gay couples to take part in the show. In the end, casting agents must not have found who they were looking for because the series ultimately got turned down.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c98f9843-3421-4314-9592-3e8027589ad4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:466db8f9-95f4-4650-a35f-ae4df3468778 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6e/5by4/2023/04/20/6e7bf9d891b2456fac941f73e03a485a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Denise Richards Confirms Return to Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. Chicago, Illinois</strong></p><p>After New York City Housewife Tinsley Mortimer got engaged to Scott Kluth, some fans suspected that the series would branch out to Chicago, where Scott was based. The show never panned out, with Andy sharing that they couldn’t find the right cast -- and would want the star to be someone who was a Chicago native anyway.</p><p>"We just didn’t find the right casting for Chicago. Whatever casting we did, it wasn’t right and we haven’t gone back to do more. That’s the issue," Andy <a href=#>said</a> in 2019. "If we were going to start a new franchise, I just think it would be with someone who had deep roots in Chicago. Who had a whole real, big life in Chicago. If she's just moving there…"</p><p><strong>4. Houston, Texas</strong></p><p>Houston, Texas was once a consideration for a "Real Housewives" franchise but it didn’t work out. Instead, producers opted to move forward with "Real Housewives of Dallas," which lasted five seasons before going on hiatus.</p><p>"You know what? We did cast in Houston a couple times. We just never nailed it," Andy <a href=#>explained</a>. "I think Houston would be great. But I think now that we have Dallas, I think we're good."</p><p><strong>5. Wine Country, California</strong></p><p>California’s Wine Country is a favorite vacation spot for many Housewives but didn’t end up making the cut for its own show. While discussing the failed franchise, Andy didn’t specify exactly which Wine Country region was in consideration -- although it could have been Napa Valley, Sonoma or Santa Rosa.</p><a id=gallery-link-f1201c0e-9f3a-4b24-a2f9-99e3b83895b6 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f1201c0e-9f3a-4b24-a2f9-99e3b83895b6 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:466db8f9-95f4-4650-a35f-ae4df3468778 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/4by3/2021/10/15/af340ad2fcf64ad6a5f09f2895229205_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21ma2tfp7KiuIyhpq6rlay2t7HSZpqirJmawG7Ax5qrZp%2BfqXqzscmemq2dlGKvunnBq5ivp18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./free-music-generators-to-make-your-own-music-and-songs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>6 Free Music Generators to Make Your Own Music and Songs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessica-kemejuk-blythe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jessica Kemejuk dating?
