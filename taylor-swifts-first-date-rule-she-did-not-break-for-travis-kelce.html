The singer didn’t shy from the topic in a recent interview, including touching upon her first date rule that she did not break for the NFL star.</strong></p><p>This was <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>‘s year and Time Magazine agrees after naming the singer the Person Of The Year. Along with a <a href=#>historical breakthrough in her career</a>, the music star’s personal life has gone through major ups and down this year. She broke up with British <a href=#>movie</a> star Joe Alwyn, but then found love again with NFL heartthrob <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1727703684-1024x779.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-claims-travis-kelce-put-her-on-blast>Taylor Swift claims Travis Kelce put her on blast</h2><p>Taylor Swift is ‘lovestruck’ with Travis Kelce, and it all began when he ‘adorably’ put her on blast after being ‘rejected’ when he attended the Eras tour. Unlike many fans who assumed the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>‘s first date was when she appeared for the athlete’s match at Arrowhead stadium in September, she shares that their first date was very much private.</p><p>Speaking of her first date with the 34-year-old <a href=#>Catching Kelce</a> star, Swift <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confessed</a>: “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.”</p><p>She added: “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple.</p><p>“I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”</p><p>As much of Taylor’s love life is in the public eye – <a href=#>she has a long list of ex lovers</a> – avoiding having the early part of the relationship in public view is how she likes to deal with things. In most cases, whether that is Harry Styles or Tom Hiddleston, the singer isn’t often snapped with a beau until they’re far into dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1830917521-557x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-shares-thoughts-on-having-a-public-relationship>Taylor Swift shares thoughts on having a ‘public relationship’</h2><p>It is no secret Taylor’s relationship with Joe Alwyn was very private. The couple were hardly ever spotted publicly and even though the <a href=#>celebrity</a> thanked Joe in her Grammy speech, the actor kept it under the wraps for the most part.</p><p>After Joe, it looks like the Cornelia Street crooner is ready to welcome a new outlook of love. The <a href=#>music</a> icon shares what it means to her to date someone else in the public eye.</p><p>The 33-year-old explained: “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, <a href=#>we’re showing up for each other</a>, other people are there and we don’t care.”</p><p>Almost as if to draw a closure for fans, the songstress admitted what it means to her to keep the relationship private and away from the limelight.</p><p>“The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow>tells</a> Time.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkn6GiqMFusMCtnGaqpaGybr%2FHnmSdoZRiu7DAjJupnpmbYrOwvoytqZqumah6rLHLnJxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andys-favorite-css-scoped-spacing-between-elements.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andys Favorite CSS (Scoped Spacing Between Elements) Chris Coyier</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elle-king-first-show-after-dolly-parton-tribute.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elle King Plays First Show Since Drunken Dolly Parton Tribute</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
