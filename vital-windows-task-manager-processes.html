The Windows system process section, which is at the bottom of the list in the Windows 10 Task Manager, holds some processes that are critical to your computer running properly.</p><p>What do these processes do, and what would happen if you ended them? Let's look at some of the most important entries in the Windows Task Manager.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Note:</strong> The newer Task Manager in Windows 8.1 and later refers to most system entries with friendly names, like <strong>Windows Logon Application</strong> instead of <strong>winlogon.exe</strong>. If you're using Windows 7, you'll see the executable file names. In later versions of Windows, right-click one and choose <strong>Properties</strong> to see its executable name.</p><h2 id=system-ntoskrnl-exe>1. System (ntoskrnl.exe)</h2><p>Windows won't let you kill the confusingly named <strong>System</strong> entry through the Task Manager. That's because it's vitally important to the internals of your device. <strong>System</strong> handles tasks at the kernel level, such as hosting drivers to make sure that software can communicate with hardware.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can imagine the consequences if you were to terminate this. Since vital drivers like accessing your disks and USB devices rely on <strong>System</strong> doing its job, closing it will lock up your system and require a hard reboot. If you need to restart <strong>System</strong> (maybe when <a href=#>troubleshooting high CPU usage</a>), you should reboot your computer normally. Regular problems with this entry could indicate a hardware problem.</p><h2 id=windows-logon-application-winlogon-exe>2. Windows Logon Application (winlogon.exe)</h2><p>You might assume that this process isn't too important once you're logged into Windows, but it's quite the opposite. Its first function is loading your user profile when you log in. <a href=#>Any Registry changes that you've made</a> to only your account take effect when you log in, thanks to this process.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Winlogon is also extremely important for security because it's hard-wired to listen for the <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Del</strong> shortcut. When you're logged in, this key combination brings up the Windows Security Screen, which contains a few quick links for you to change your password, sign out, and similar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Windows-Security-Screen.png><p>But you can also <a href=#>enable an option called Secure sign-in</a> that requires you to press <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Del</strong> when logging into Windows. Because the "three-finger salute" is always caught by <strong>winlogon</strong>, pressing it ensures that you see the actual Windows logon screen and not a fake designed to steal your password.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>To complete its duties, <strong>winlogon</strong> also displays the screen saver and/or locks your PC after you've been away for some time. If you try to use the <strong>End Process</strong> command on the Task Manager, Windows will warn you that this is a bad idea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/End-Windows-Logon-Application.jpg><p>Do it anyway, and your PC will go completely black with no hope for recovery. You'd have to reboot to get it running again at that point.</p><h2 id=windows-start-up-application-wininit-exe>3. Windows Start-Up Application (wininit.exe)</h2><p><strong>Wininit</strong> is a process that helps Windows get situated when you first log in, and needs to stay running for the entire duration of your use. Its most important function is acting as a springboard for most background apps and processes that run when you start Windows. This includes starting other critical processes like <strong>lsass.exe</strong> and <strong>lsm.exe</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>It runs until you shut your computer down. Trying to end it prematurely will result in a Windows prompt warning you not to do this. And like Winlogon, doing so anyway crashes the system to the point of needing a reboot.</p><h2 id=client-server-runtime-process-csrss-exe>4. Client Server Runtime Process (csrss.exe)</h2><p>Another sibling in the essential Windows process family, <strong>csrss</strong>'s role has changed throughout Windows' evolution. In the really old days, this process handled all the graphical elements of Windows. But now, it handles a few background functions instead.</p><p>Its two most critical roles are shutting down Windows and launching the <strong>conhost.exe</strong> process, which launches the Command Prompt. This might not sound like much, but it's a vital process. If something gets screwed up and this process doesn't run at boot, you'll get a blue screen.</p><p>As you might have guessed, ignoring Windows' advice about ending this process will result in a frozen system.</p><h2 id=windows-session-manager-smss-exe>5. Windows Session Manager (smss.exe)</h2><p>Another critical part of the Windows boot process (see a theme here?), the Windows Session Manager process has been around since Windows 3.1.</p><p>Whenever Windows loads up, <strong>smss</strong> makes a few preparations first. It maps your drives and <a href=#>creates virtual memory paging</a>, to name a few. Once it's finished, it calls <strong>winlogon</strong> and you see the login screen.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Obviously, the Session Manager stays alive after you've logged in. It watches both <strong>winlogon</strong> and <strong>csrss</strong> to wait for either one of them to end. If this occurs as part of a standard routine, Windows will shut down as normal. But if either process ends unexpectedly, <strong>smss</strong> will freeze up your computer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Windows-Session-Manager-Process.png><p>Like the above processes, trying to end this one through the Task Manager results in a warning and then a locked-up system.</p><h2 id=windows-shell-experience-host>6. Windows Shell Experience Host</h2><p>Here's a newer process that works almost exclusively with elements new to Windows 10. If you've used a previous version of Windows, you likely noticed the fresh coat of paint that Windows 10 applied to staples like the clock and calendar. The Shell Experience Host process handles these elements, along with the color and transparency effects of the Start menu and Taskbar.</p><p>In addition to the updated look, this process also works to display Store apps in a window. If you use a slideshow as your wallpaper, you can thank Shell Experience Host for making it happen. Unlike many other processes on this list, closing it won't crash your system. Instead, Windows will simply restart it after a few seconds. But there's no reason to close it—doing so won't change the look of Windows.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=windows-explorer-explorer-exe>7. Windows Explorer (explorer.exe)</h2><p>This entry doesn't hold Windows together, but it does handle much of the graphical interface you use every day. But what happens if you end Windows Explorer in the Task Manager?</p><p>As it turns out, terminating <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> will not only close any open File Explorer windows, but it will also render the Start menu, Taskbar, and System Tray unusable.</p><p>However, restarting Explorer can actually prove to be helpful. If your Start Menu or <a href=#>Taskbar starts acting up</a>, a quick restart of this process can clear up issues. It's much faster than restarting your PC for a minor issue limited to Windows Explorer.</p><p>In Windows 8.1 and later, you can right-click on <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> and choose <strong>Restart</strong> to instantly kill and re-run it. On Windows 7, you'll have to right-click it and choose <strong>End Process</strong>, then go to <strong>File > Run new task</strong> and enter <strong>explorer.exe</strong> to get it going again.</p><p>There are other <a href=#>ways to restart File Explorer</a> if needed, so be aware of them for the next time you accidentally end Windows Explorer's task.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Windows-Explorer-Restart.jpg><h2 id=be-aware-of-critical-windows-processes>Be Aware of Critical Windows Processes</h2><p>The processes we've looked at certainly aren't the only mission-critical ones running in your Task Manager. But they're all vital to your Windows experience in some way, and now you know what they do.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Thankfully, in most cases, Windows protects you from doing something stupid and shutting these down, so you don't have much to worry about.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Task Manager is useful for a lot more than you might think. It's hiding handy tools beyond letting you view system processes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fq7a1rctmrqKmlKTEtHnTmqqkZZ2Wu6KzxKtkqaqfmLK0v8SsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charlie-puth-signs-management-deal-with-ron-laffitte-at-maverick.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charlie Puth Signs Management Deal With Ron Laffitte At Maverick</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-edward-snowden-now-wife-lindsay-mills-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Edward Snowden Now -What Happened To Him?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
