She starred on the Documentary film, <a href=#>Cesar Millan: The Real Story</a>. The film documents her fiancé’s incredible journey. He started as a poor illegal immigrant from Mexico, slowly rising to become one of the most bankable faces on reality television.</p><p>The documentary was released back on November 25th, 2012. Eight years later, and it’s still fondly talked about. It comes as no surprise as the documentary featured the likes of Jahira Dar, Tara King, Calvin Milan, and Cesar himself.</p><p>Jahira Dar was once an employee of a Dolce & Gabbana chain store. It is a luxury fashion company founded in Italy back in 1985. Thirty years later, and it is one of the most recognizable brands in the industry. While its headquarters are in Milan, the company has chain stores all over the world. After this, Jahira tried her luck with wardrobe consulting.</p><p>Most of her work here entailed advising her clients on all matters regarding fashion.

It makes her an Aquarius, and judging by her creative nature; we are not surprised one bit.</p><h2><strong>Jahira Dar’s Net worth, Sources of Income.</strong></h2><p>The fashion expert has tried different careers over the years. From working at Dolce and Gabbana to featuring on a documentary film, Jahira has had various sources of income.</p><p>Her net worth, however, is presently under review. Her future husband, Cesar Millan, is a man of means. Currently, Cesar is worth <a href=#>$45 million</a>. He has amassed this wealth from an extended run on television. Jahira is his fiancé and enjoys the lifestyle that comes with this wealth.</p><h2><strong>Relationship with Cesar Millan.</strong></h2><p>Jahira met Cesar Millan back in 2010, sometime around August. At the time, Cesar was going through one of the hardest periods of his life. He had recently divorced from his ex-wife, Ilusion Millan, a few months earlier. Cesar Milan’s fiance Ilusion was additionally suing him for full custody of their sons, Calvin and Andre.</p><p>If she won, he would be required to pay over $ 20,000 in child support per month. A little further down the line, we learned that Cesar had also lost his most faithful companion, an American bull terrier named Daddy. The combination of all of this left him in a state of depression. It even forced him to take some time off from his popular television show.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-287 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jahira-Dar-fiance-cesar.jpg alt="Image of Jahira Dar with her fiance, Cesar Millan" width=600 height=581 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-287 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Caption: Jahira Dar with her fiance, Cesar Millan</strong></p><p>Jahira came into his life shortly after.

She helped him through the hardest of times, and with her by his side, Cesar rebuilt his life.</p><p>Jahira and Cesar spent six years together before he eventually popped the question.
