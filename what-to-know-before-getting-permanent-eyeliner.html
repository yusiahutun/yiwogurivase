If you've stood in the mirror trying to apply a pencil or liquid liner, you know what we're talking about. Between your eyes watering, the line becoming wonky, and the liquid smudging, a lot of frustration can amount. So it's no wonder that permanent eyeliner, or an eyeliner tattoo, has become increasingly popular.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The treatment is considered permanent because the pigment used to create the line can remain in your skin forever, however, the longevity of the color and its visibility will fade over time. That said, it's actually more of a semi-<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>permanent makeup (PMU)</a> procedure that replaces the need to apply eyeliner every day. To find out more about the beauty treatment, we turned to experts Daly Beneche, Dr. Mariana Vergara, and Dr. Glen K. Goodman.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for our complete guide to getting permanent eyeliner.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-benefits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Benefits</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Permanent eyeliner enhances the eyes without the use of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>liquid liners</a>&nbsp;and pencils — simply put, it will make your eyes pop. The procedure also helps to improve the appearance of light-colored or missing lashes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are many reasons why someone might choose to get permanent eyeliner," said Beneche. "Not only does it save you time each morning, but you'll also save a ton of money on eyeliner products."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beneche noted that most clinics offer various lines for you to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our signature is the Angel Wing Eyeliner, but we do offer other lines based on the needs and desires of the client," Beneche added. "We have a lash line, a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wing line</a>, and a stardust eyeliner, for example."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prepare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prepare</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are thinking about getting permanent eyeliner, there are a few precautions Beneche advised that you should be aware of to ensure a smooth procedure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Please do not work out the day of the procedure as the body heat will expand the pores," said the Arch Angels master artist. "Avoid heavy sunlight three days before your treatment as your skin should not be in the process of healing."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have a sunburn, Beneche recommended waiting four to five days before performing the procedure. Other precautions include avoiding coffee before your treatment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Caffeine will act as a blood thinner and can cause you to bleed more than average," explained Beneche. It's also important to avoid drinking alcohol the night before treatment, as this can lower your pain threshold.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-expect></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Expect</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Arch Angels NYC, their popular&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Angel Wing Liner</a>&nbsp;involves depositing hypoallergenic mineral pigments into the dermal layer of the skin using an ultra-thin needle. The procedure typically takes two and a half hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We begin by numbing the skin and drawing the shape of the liner," said Beneche. "Then, we use a digital machine to pixelate the pigment into the skin. We repeat this method a few times to ensure the pigment stays." Unlike traditional eyeliner and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brow tattoos</a>, pigments used for permanent makeup do not penetrate as deeply into the skin layer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, although skin tests are not typically required, some salons do offer them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We determine if a test is needed by reviewing skin allergies, medical history, and other personal details that may impact eligibility," noted Beneche. "We automatically do a test if a client indicates any concerns, allergies, or other medical conditions during the intake process."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ironically, permanent eyeliner is not as permanent as the name suggests. On average, you can expect the line to last one to three years.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Constantly using eye creams, oils, and other products can cause the ink to fade over time," Dr. Vergara told us. "Not only does the color change, but as the ink is placed at the surface of the skin, the precision of the line also decreases."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-risks-and-safety></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Risks and Safety</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Goodman, permanent eyeliner is generally considered a safe procedure if performed by an experienced practitioner in a medical-grade clean environment, employing completely sterile techniques. However, as the procedure is invasive, the ophthalmologist added that there are no guarantees against complications — so make sure you do your research and find a reputable establishment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The most serious risk is an infection," said Dr. Goodman. "Pathogens can be placed inadvertently into the eyelid, and from there, they can infect the surrounding soft tissues."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other risks include allergic reactions, migration of the applied pigments, excessive or irregular scarring, and keloid formation. Dr. Vergara advised pregnant women and patients with autoimmune disorders like lupus to avoid having permanent eyeliner treatment to prevent complications.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-side-effects></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Side Effects</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Immediate side effects can include swelling, bleeding, and bruising. "You may also experience burning, itching, or discomfort around the injection site," said Beneche. "However, these side effects should only last a few days."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beneche also explained that the eyeliner color will typically appear much darker for up to 10 days after the procedure. So, make sure you're aware of all the anticipated aftercare before undergoing your procedure.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You should receive written instructions upon discharge, 24/7 access to the practitioner, a formal post-operative appointment schedule, and a written description of the specific product(s) applied," said Dr. Goodman. "Generally, mascara, harsh skin cleaners, UV tanning, and skin exfoliants are to be avoided while the eyelids heal."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cost</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The price of getting permanent eyeliner can vary. On average, you can expect to pay anywhere from $600 to $1000, depending on the style, color, and thickness of the eyeliner.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-removal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Removal</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fortunately, permanent eyeliner is not a life sentence. If you have the treatment and hate it, it can be removed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At our studios, we use PhiRemoval, a painless and very safe procedure that leaves no scarring," said Beneche. "PhiRemoval is ideal because, unlike laser or saline, it does not scar, the tissue heals quickly, and it's less traumatic and invasive on the skin."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMSprdNmq6hlm6O8uHnBnp2oqpVitKbA06KloGWgmr%2Burc2epa1lla6yrbXNnqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristian-bruun.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kristian Bruun dating?
