She was born in Columbia, Missouri, United States. She is an American national of African-American ethnicity. She grew up with her mother – who raised her as a single parent.</p><p class=align-left>Nischelle Turner spent her childhood in Columbia, Missouri, where they lived close to extended family members from her mother's side. As a result, she has a close bond with both her mother and her relatives. She started her <a href=#>education</a> at Rock Bridge Elementary.</p><p class=align-left>She then joined Jefferson Middle School before going to Rock Bridge High School for her <a href=#>high school </a>education. She credits both her mother and grandmother for pushing her to complete her education, despite not having much formal education. After graduation, Turner was admitted to the University of Kentucky, wanting a change of pace from her Missouri childhood.</p><p class=align-left>However, the <a href=#>TV personality</a> would drop out of the institution in her junior year, returning to Missouri. This was because she wanted to attend the best journalism school, right in her hometown – the University of Missouri.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/41002f39029fedb2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maria Sansone: Family, career, thyroid cancer, what happened</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84b8d468c49615c7.png><p class=align-left>At first, Turner had a bit of a hard time assimilating to life at Missouri University. Nonetheless, she pressed forward, and soon she was making friends and grabbing journalism opportunities. Most notably, she joined the G7, a group of like-minded students studying journalism.</p><p class=align-left>Turner also worked at KOMU-TV, University of Missouri's commercial radio station that is an affiliate of NBC – the only of its kind in the US. At the TV station, she grew her journalistic skills with the help of mentors such as Stacey Woelfel.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Are you wondering how Turner became the TV personality and journalist she is today? Below is a look at her career progress over the years:</p><h3>Starting at WEHT</h3><p class=align-left>Nischelle Turner graduated with a degree in Journalism from the University of Missouri in 1998. After graduation, she landed her first job with WEHT, an ABC affiliate station based in Evansville, Indiana.

The opportunity would see her work as an anchor and weekday <a href=#>reporter</a> – a promotion from her current gig.</p><p class=align-left>At first, Turner turned down the offer, not wanting to move to the city. However, she fell in love with New Orleans culture after agreeing to an interview. She also loved the station's newsroom, which she described as the best in the <a href=#>world</a>.</p><p class=align-left>After spending several years in New Orleans, Turner got another job opportunity in Los Angeles, working for KTTV FOX 11. The job saw her working as a general assignment reporter, but with stints in sports broadcasting.

She also did sports broadcasting, another of her passion, with notable assignments, including the coverage of basketball telecasts.</p><h3>Move to CNN</h3><p class=align-left>Turner made another move, this time to HLN, a station that is affiliated to CNN. She was offered a job as an entertainment correspondent and hosted Showbiz Tonight, a show reporting <a href=#>celebrity</a> news and scandals.</p><p class=align-left>Soon after, Turner started covering entertainment news for the CNN network. Some of her most notable assignments include covering Golden Globes, Oscars, Grammys, and other red carpet events.
