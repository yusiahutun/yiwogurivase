Now, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Business Insider</a> is reporting that Jasmine is in talks with a popular apparel chain that has more than 450 stores worldwide, though she asked that the name of the retailer be withheld, as negotiations are still underway.</p><p>Jasmine says that if her curved mirrors do end up in big stores—it’s apparently already in some small boutiques—it won’t be with the intention to dupe you. The&nbsp;Skinny Mirror logo is&nbsp;visible on every product.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/VOS-Body.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tiktokwavymirror.gif?w=960&h=580&crop=1"><p><strong>From July 2013:</strong><br>There’s not a&nbsp;woman&nbsp;among us who hasn’t had some sort of&nbsp;experience&nbsp;with the double-edged sword known as the “skinny mirror.” You know, that certain type of highly-skewed reflective device that makes you appear about 10 pounds lighter and maybe even a little taller, too.</p><p>(No, you haven’t? Next time you’re in a sample sale dressing room, notice how all the mirrors are tilted backwards, as opposed to standing straight up. Yes, that’s why everything in a sample dressing room looks good on you.)</p><p>While many women might find the idea of looking&nbsp;falsely&nbsp;fabulous depressing, it seems that others&nbsp;are so&nbsp;enamored&nbsp;by their faux-svelte selves that they’re shelling out anywhere from $160 to $600 to install their&nbsp;own&nbsp;intentional skinny&nbsp;mirrors.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>According to the Daily Mail</a>, graphic designer and&nbsp;entrepreneur Belinda Jasmine founded a company called&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>The Skinny Mirror,</a>&nbsp;which sells full-length mirrors that use curved glass technology to make women appear thinner. The&nbsp;idea &nbsp;was born after Jasmine—despite&nbsp;being an avid surfer and health enthusiast—became fed up with feeling like she didn’t look good in clothes because she thought she had a “fat mirror.”</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-192181"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/skinnymirrorcompare11.gif alt="skinny mirror belinda jasmine " width=450 height=574 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Although she knew it was the mirror that made her look bigger, she still found herself believing&nbsp;she was larger then she actually was, which prompted her to create mirrors that show women a slimmer version of themselves.</p><p>“I used The Skinny Mirror prototype for weeks before I committed to do start The Skinny Mirror company,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jasmine writes on the company’s website</a>. “Over time, I felt how it affected my self-image. I stood up taller, felt sexier, and wanted to dress cuter. It was important for me to make this available to individuals so that they too might have an improved body image.”</p><p>While it make sense that women would embrace things&nbsp;that make&nbsp;us&nbsp;feel more confident (and—for better or worse—most of us probably&nbsp;will like the way we look in The Skinny Mirror), it’s hard to&nbsp;ignore&nbsp;the fact that what we’re looking at isn’t real, a pretty big caveat in our book.</p><p>However, Jasmine believes that seeing ourselves in skinny mirrors will have long-term postive effects on our confidence, as our self-image is directly tied to our energy levels, feelings of competence and perceived attractiveness.</p><p>“It’s the same feeling you get when someone tells you, ‘You look nice today,'” she said.</p><p>Whether The&nbsp;Skinny&nbsp;Mirror catches on a major way remains to be seen, but women are smart creatures and most of us probably won’t want to rely on trickery to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;“better” versions of ourselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhpaWd%2BeISOrKKipp6ueq610aumq2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-behaviour-that-are-found-in-emotional-people.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Behaviours That Are Found in Emotional People</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-sync-itunes-to-your-android-phone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Sync iTunes to Your Android Phone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
