"Wearing one of his dresses makes you feel like a princess,"&nbsp;she smiles. Oscar is as big a fan of Lara. "Her taste in fashion has always interlaced with the couture fashion I create,"&nbsp;he told us. "We have been able to create pieces that will be fused onto American history; from the [President's] inaugural ball to the more intimate pieces she wears for her day-to-day. "It's a pleasure to be able to continue to produce fashion statements with Lara, now and for years to come… My designs have an everpresent wow factor."</p><p id=ezxw5ufM7aPV data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's famous celebrity friends: From Elton John to David and Victoria Beckham</a></strong></p><p id=eMZwPhS9yJy7 data-wc=31>Lara spoke to <strong>HELLO!</strong> about her UK visit, her pregnancy fitness regime and how she and Eric are helping to prepare Luke to become a big brother. Read the interview below...</p><p id=en1t2LannlyX data-wc=12><strong>Who did you most enjoy meeting on your trip to London, Lara?</strong></p><p id=ejHUGYyK2bkA data-wc=4>"The Queen, of course!"</p><p id=eeo4nw9fvb5R data-wc=9><strong>How is your pregnancy going? Do you feel good?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ej4hjte0CoYv data-wc=49>"This pregnancy is definitely harder than my first. I've been so fortunate to be able to continue to do most of the athletic endeavours that I enjoy for both pregnancies, but I have certainly felt different this time around. They say no two pregnancies are alike – they're right."</p><p id=eyclu3jaaVKC data-wc=2><strong>Any cravings?</strong></p><p id=eczfC5E_cpfx data-wc=34>"During my last pregnancy, I couldn't get enough pancakes but, for this one, I seem to have a fruit obsession. Mango, pineapple, grapes – especially frozen grapes – are always top of my list."</p><p id=eo-uhnwK3zfh data-wc=5><strong>When is your baby due?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eiaT5QfNrR6O data-wc=2>"August 21st."</p><p id=emP6Mf1cMBn8 data-wc=11><strong>Do you know if you're having a boy or a girl?</strong></p><p id=ewrgcQFPVF9O data-wc=1>"Yes!"</p><p id=eFrfvK0PTAEE data-wc=13><strong>You are famously a dog lover. Do you bring the dogs to Mar-a-Lago?</strong></p><p id=exAxOWbV0mMa data-wc=37>"Of course – in the middle of the cold New York winter, it's as much a treat for them to come down, run on the beach and in the water as it is for all of us."</p><p id=eV6wzVjS1Cxy data-wc=8><strong>How have you prepared Luke for the birth?</strong></p><p id=e5OsUZ_rUwH3 data-wc=85>"Everyone asks me about Luke and if he knows he'll be a big brother. Truth is, at 23 months old, he's more concerned with kicking a soccer ball and zooming his trucks around our home than the new addition coming to our family. We have certainly told him that there's a baby in Mom's belly but I'm not sure he fully appreciates what’s about to happen. He is such a loving, sweet little boy, so I have no doubt he will be an amazing brother."</p><p id=emtl2Rjj5AHk data-wc=9><strong>How do you think you will cope with two?</strong></p><p id=ePLUWpI9ug0U data-wc=87>"I'm slightly terrified as to how it will be. Keeping up with one is a full-time job, let alone two. But I think about military spouses at a time like this – moms and dads whose spouse is overseas serving our country. These incredible parents are taking care of two, three, four or more kids and they're doing it alone. They really inspire me and, whenever I start to get nervous about having a second child, I think: 'If they can do it, I can do it.'"</p><p id=em1jZZN_RBKH data-wc=23><strong>You're a keen athlete and worked out during your first pregnancy. Will you be working out during the whole of this one too?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=epvJK2TynHZv data-wc=67>"As long as I feel good, I plan to keep working out. I think it helped me mentally and physically during my first pregnancy and I feel the same way now. "I've slowed down quite a bit and can't do everything that I do when not pregnant but, overall, I'm very lucky that I've been able to continue to exercise and do what makes me feel good."</p><p id=erj0veyeOW99 data-wc=11><strong>How do you think keeping fit helped with you last birth?</strong></p><p id=eBf_nttKu_aw data-wc=34>"My son's birth was incredibly long and much, much harder than I ever anticipated. The fact that I was able to stay fit during the pregnancy truly helped me make it through that delivery."</p><p id=eelxNiqtaZqo data-wc=14><strong>Do you think your fitness helped you regain your pre-baby body more quickly, too?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eQPjSHZHA2Os data-wc=83>"It probably did help me to feel like myself again faster but, oddly enough, I thought that would be a major focus of mine after Luke's birth but I found that I really gave myself time and was okay with not 'bouncing back'&nbsp;immediately. Any woman who has given birth knows that your body goes through an incredible amount of trauma and change in such a short amount of time – I was okay with taking it easy and recovering for a while."</p><p id=eq_0pjbsAkya data-wc=7><strong>Talk us through your fitness routine now…</strong></p><p id=eC9cVnpqDrdl data-wc=80>"These days, my favourite thing to do is swim. I love competing in triathlons and I've always found the swim to be the most challenging part but, at eight months pregnant, it's the one place that I don’t feel as big as I am. I do a lot of cycling classes, lap swimming and lighter weightlifting. I stopped running a few weeks ago, which was a bit of a bummer. I've tried to supplement with the elliptical and stair-climber machines."</p><p id=epENvc9ZVe-c data-wc=10><strong>What is Eric like as a father? Is he hands-on?</strong></p><p id=ebnSqNjzcItM data-wc=75>"He's an awesome dad. I always knew he would be. His favourite thing to do with Luke is to tickle and wrestle with him. When he walks in the door from work, Luke is giggling until bedtime. Our weekends are the best because we truly relax as a family. Luke's favourite toys are trucks so I'm fairly certain that my husband will be having Luke driving a tractor or fixing a car in no time."</p><p id=e8Iz5pDvLIlD data-wc=13><strong>What has been the highlight of the Trump Presidency for you so far?</strong></p><p id=eBj0RuiF-6KN data-wc=92>"Wow, I'm not even sure how to choose just one thing. I'm so proud of my father-in-law and all that he’s been able to accomplish. I knew that if Americans gave him a chance, he would do an amazing job as our President. It has been incredible to witness how he has improved the lives of all of the people in this country, despite the constant attacks by his opponents and much of the media. Unlike most politicians, he has kept the promises he made in 2016 and our country is thriving."</p><p id=eCiGJmlH6hnw data-wc=10><strong>How do you deal with the criticism thrown your way?</strong></p><p id=evoq22vVP9rA data-wc=93>"You have to take it all with a grain of salt, so to speak. I know I'm a good person and I know the things I stand up and fight for every day are right. I also know the mainstream media and the President's opponents are looking for any way to hurt the President, and sometimes that's us. While it’s never fun to see negative things said or written about you, I know who I am and so do my friends and family. At the end of the day, that’s what truly matters."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5592ec26c26e-lara-trum-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eaSPNThPVkDJ data-wc=13><strong>Lara Trump welcomed her second child with Donald Trump's son, Eric, in August</strong></p><p id=eBxHiQsVe7yM data-wc=6><strong>How does Eric deal with it?</strong></p><p id=eSiiFZlowJY8 data-wc=72>"We both know we're good people and believe in fighting for this country. Sadly, there are people out there who will do anything they can to try to hurt this President and that means even attacking his family. As parents, we always strive to set an example for our son and, by standing up for what we believe in and keeping our heads high, we feel that we do that every day."</p><p id=eWPIoN8h-nB3 data-wc=15><strong>Did you have to make many changes to your day-to-day life when Donald became President?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eA1A85NeLGgG data-wc=58>"I think the most notable change has been the fact that we all have Secret Service protection. At first, it's a strange thing to have people with you all the time but the men and women of the United States Secret Service are truly incredible people and we are honoured to have them by our sides every day."</p><p id=ehSGajntGsNm data-wc=18><strong>Tell us about Mar-a-Lago, the place where you got married. What do you enjoy most about coming here?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e2qIvyUSM-2Z data-wc=41>"I love Mar-a-Lago. It's an absolutely beautiful property that truly feels like our second home. I wish we had the opportunity to visit more often. We spend probably four or five weekends here in winter, including Thanksgiving, New Year and Easter."</p><p id=e0v6oVlat93d data-wc=10><strong>Has your fashion style changed since you became a mother?</strong></p><p id=eEm2INCUrDYH data-wc=44>"Not really. I think as we all grow older, our styles evolve – there are things I wore in college that I'd never wear today. I’m proud that even as a mom I can still be stylish and rock a lot of different looks."</p><p id=ekUDKz_NvOa4 data-wc=11><strong>Is there a big difference between your on- and off-duty style?</strong></p><p id=e92xSqbz_T7y data-wc=65>"There's definitely a difference between how I dress on the weekends and how I dress during the week. At weekends and when I'm on vacation, it's all about comfort and chasing a toddler around. While I love feeling chic and sophisticated during the work week, there's nothing quite like putting on a comfy pair of jeans and a tank top when Friday afternoon rolls around."</p><p id=ejSNiqVMPX-T data-wc=5><strong>Who are your favourite designers?</strong></p><p id=eU4SSXP47WR5 data-wc=26>"There are so many. I love Veronica Beard suits, Stella McCartney, Chiara Boni La Petite Robe, Roland Mouret, Carolina Herrera, Alaïa and, of course, Oscar López."</p><p id=ewlkx5nMqrlB data-wc=8><strong>What do you like most about Oscar’s designs?</strong></p><p id=e7mgRF2lzmmr data-wc=6>"They are unpredictable and absolutely beautiful."</p><p id=ekmhoPTXxmdY data-wc=11><strong>How does your style differ from that of your sister-in-law Ivanka?</strong></p><p id=eHsUgW4WFJjV data-wc=28>"Actually, our styles don't differ all that much. I think she has become bolder in her fashion statements and I love how effortlessly she pulls off a look."</p><p id=ef5Y90FQe9c5 data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
