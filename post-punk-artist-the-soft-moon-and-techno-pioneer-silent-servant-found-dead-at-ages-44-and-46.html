Vasquez was 44, and Mendez was 46. <strong>Simone Ling,</strong> identified as Mendez’s partner, was also found dead. She was 43.</p><p>The Facebook page for the Soft Moon confirmed Vasquez’s death in a post. “It is with great sadness that we announce our dear friend, Luis Vasquez, has passed away,” the group wrote. “Our hearts and thoughts are with his family, friends, and extended music family.”</p><p>The statement continued, “We ask you to respect their privacy during this difficult time. If you have a memory of Luis, no matter if you were a close friend of his or not, please feel free to share. This is a huge loss, and our hearts are broken.”</p><p>The three were found Thursday (January 18) at Mendez’s and Ling’s residence at the Pacific Electric Lofts on Main Street after a welfare check was requested by Vasquez’s wife, according to the <a href=#><span>LA Times</span></a>. Sources told the news outlet that drug paraphernalia was found at the scene, and the case is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department Central Bureau (LAPD) as a possible fentanyl overdose. Authorities anticipate that it may take three to six months before the final causes of death are determined, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner’s Office.</p><p>Captain Raul Jovel, who leads the Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) Central Division, said, “It’s so sad for their families. This is a societal issue.”</p><p><span><strong>The Soft Moon</strong></span></p><p>Vasquez’s official Facebook page confirmed his death in the post listed above.</p><p>Vasquez was born in East Los Angeles and moved to the Mojave Desert as a child. Vasquez started his first band at the age of 15 after his grandfather gifted him a guitar three years earlier, according to a <a href=#><span>Flaunt</span></a> interview in 2018. He found more mainstream success with the Soft Moon, which his Spotify biography page called an “unflinching mix of industrial and post-punk.” Vasquez said the Soft Moon was a “personal project,” and he wrote all of the band’s songs for that reason, according to his interview with the music site <a href=#><span>post-punk.com</span></a>.</p><p>Vasquez also listed Prince, Michael Jackson, Brian Eno, and Madonna as artists that he loved but clarified, “I’m mainly influenced by existence. Music is the tool which feels most natural for me to express myself.”</p><p>He has toured with acts such as Interpol, Mogwai, and Depeche Mode. During his career, he released five albums.</p><p><span><strong>Silent Servant</strong></span></p><p>Mendez’s management company, Triangle Agency, confirmed his death via email to the Resident Advisor.&nbsp;</p><p>Mendez was a key player in electronic music for over three decades and left an indelible mark on the techno scene. He was a vital part of the Sandwell District techno collective alongside Regis, Female, and Function. After the collective wrapped up in 2011, he co-launched the Jealous God record label with Regis and James Ruskin, featuring releases from Varg, Phase Fatale, and Black Merlin.</p><p>Mendez’s own music was released on labels such as Cititrax, BITE, and Hospital Productions. His final solo record, the In Memoriam was released November 2023 via Tresor. A new Sandwell District compilation, WHERE NEXT?&nbsp;just got announced this week.</p><p>As a DJ, Mendez was a fixture in some of the hottest techno clubs globally, including Berghain, Tresor, Bassiani, and KHIDI.</p><p>Mendez had a monthly NTS Radio show where he’d dive into new wave, minimal synth, and industrial music – genres he loved. In addition to his love of music, Mendez was an art director and photographer.</p><p>Read below for some tributes to both men.</p><p>RIP.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Devastated to hear about the passing of Juan, Silent Servant + Luis, Soft Moon.
