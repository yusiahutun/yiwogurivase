Cute right? Maybe, not. It seems Kanye West may be using it to launch some ‘bizarre’ goods and services, including biological cloning.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> making headlines for ‘being bizarre’ isn’t new. Just a few weeks ago, Ye posted a bunch of ‘almost nude’ pics of his wife to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to celebrate her birthday. He captioned one of the posts: “I miss you when I wake up before you,” and it looks like that may be the new trademark.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1254695399-731x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kanye-west-plans-to-launch-biological-cloning-inspired-by-wife-bianca>Kanye West plans to launch “biological cloning” inspired by wife Bianca</h2><p>Documents <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">obtained</a> by The Daily Mail show the 46-year-old has filed 228 trademarks under his company Ox Paha, Inc. The most recent being, under the name, ‘I MISS YOU WHEN I WAKE UP BEFORE YOU’.</p><p>The documents reveal plans to launch an array of ‘bizarre’ items, including biological cloning and wireless receivers in the form of jewelry, as well as chemical research and a life-size inflatable dummy with a water-filled base. Interesting…</p><p>The star’s attorney, Gregory K. Nelson, confirmed the news to the publication, stating the <a href=#>music</a> star filed the applications on behalf of the company.</p><p>However, those who are waiting in line to get their biological cloning services may have to wait that bit longer, as the publication states “the trademark application has been accepted by the Office but has not yet been assigned to an examiner.”</p><p>Other ‘services’ listed that fans can hope to look forward to are floating recreational lounge chairs and squeezable squeaking toys.</p><p>Ye’s been busy, as he recently announced the presale of the <a href=#>YZY POD shoes</a>, which he claims are the future of footwear.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rapper-angers-fans-with-another-delayed-release-date>The rapper ‘angers’ fans with ANOTHER delayed release date</h2><p>Although it looks like the Runaway rapper is embarking on new adventures, he may want to finish the one he promised fans.</p><p>Kanye is due to release his ‘comeback album’ in collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign, but the release date has been pushed back once again.</p><p>The rap duo have been teasing their joint album Vultures for months, but we haven’t heard a peep. All we do know now is that the release date has been pushed back to February 9, but after numerous delays, we won’t hold our breath.</p><p>Vultures was originally scheduled to be released on December 15 but was then delayed to New Year’s Eve, however, it wasn’t meant to be in 2023. Two more changes and the most recent date was set for two days from today, January 19, but of course, that isn’t happening.</p><p>The way things are going right now, it looks like we’re going to get Kanye’s biological cloning services before new music.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aEcLfAsqWeZaeawLV5z6WYp6tdqbxuuMCupZygXZe2sLjOoKCcmZxisK27zaKloGWjmr%2B3tcKeqmahnqi9qr7EnWSbsV2stqexjJugmqaTlnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-naked-british-gq.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Gets Totally Naked for British GQ</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julia-roberts-dating-history-list-of-all-her-relationships.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julia Roberts Dating History: List of Marriages, Relationships</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
