Only one side street, where dozens of shops have been barricaded shut, hints at the persistence of the police raids.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The kilometre-long lane was until recently described by local people as a used-clothes market but, following the raids, many traders have taken their business off the side streets and into houses and offices in the surrounding maze of alleys. No outsiders can find them; only well-connected motorcycle-taxi drivers know where the clothes are being sold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'You said you were from Guangzhou, right? Can I see your ID?' Chen, a Jieshi native, asked suspiciously in the living room of his three-storey house. Inside, used clothes were piled up to the ceiling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen, a father of three, said that since being exposed by China Central Television late last month, Jieshi's traders had to be wary of strangers, fearing they might be reporters or plain-clothes police officers from northern provinces. After agreeing to a deal on products and price, Chen rode his motorbike to his secret storehouse and returned 20 minutes later with 10 used suit jackets of different brands, styles and colours, priced at 15 yuan (HK$17) each.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Please forgive him: if you came a month ago, or in a few months' time when there are no campaigns, nobody would be so impolite,' a motorcycle driver named Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everybody involved in the business was lying low, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another trader, a bald man in his 40s with a big gold ring on his finger, said he had no used clothing left.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'No, no, no. I don't have such things anymore,' he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The clothing distributed in Jieshi comes from Japan, South Korea, Europe and the US. Many are brand names, and they feed a thriving market of brand-hungry consumers who cannot afford luxury prices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Jieshi traders are working in a legal grey area. Used clothing is not illegal to sell per se, unlike more notorious smuggled items such as narcotics and firearms. Nor are customs authorities missing out on lucrative excise duties as in for big-ticket smuggled items like luxury cars, precious metals and cigarettes. But it is illegal to import second-hand clothes as, under environmental regulations, such items are labelled waste.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, once an item of used clothing enters the market, it is almost impossible to trace its source.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to a Jieshi native familiar with the smuggling industry, roughly 25 per cent of the town's workforce is involved in the import, transport, cleaning and distribution of used clothes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The man, who gave his name only as Lin, said used clothes were packed into sacks weighing 50-75kg, and each sack cost several hundred yuan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many of the clothes had been earmarked for donation in their original countries or had been thrown away.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The leaders of the operation are not based in Jieshi - mainland media reports suggested some were Jieshi natives based in Hong Kong - but they control the town's underground sales network.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Jieshi is the distribution centre for this type of smuggling. It's been famous for this for years,' Lin said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Lin, many of the clothes do not reach Jieshi through its port, but rather by road from Vietnam. Last week, CCTV reported that a driver had been stopped on the Shenzhen-Shantou highway with a truck full of used clothes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The driver said the van had been loaded in Dongxing , a town in Guangxi that borders Vietnam.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the traders in Jieshi, the used clothing can be a lucrative business - with a little luck.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Do not be surprised if you find Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent or some other world-famous brands in the sacks,' Lin said. 'I used to have a pair of woollen trousers my uncle said would cost 2,000 yuan [HK$2,270] in a mainland department store.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once clothing reaches Jieshi, traders go through the sacks to look for valuable items. These are sold on to distributors from other provinces for anything from 10 yuan to 300 yuan an item. Lin said many distributors were from Shanghai and Zhejiang , who claimed they could sell the goods on at a tenfold profit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bargain-hunting mainland consumers can choose between second-hand clothing and knock-offs to slake their thirst for YSL and the like.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is a price to pay for such bargains, of course - fake clothing is often poorly made, while there is concern over the source of used clothing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In downtown Guangzhou, behind the famous Garden Hotel, a small shop 'specialising in imported clothes' sells Levi's jeans for 50 yuan a pair. Such stores are dotted all around Guangzhou and every other mainland city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ivy Li, a white-collar worker who visits Guangzhou's second-hand shops regularly, said customers had to be careful about the clothing since some items may be more than just 'used' - for example, they may have been taken from dead people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lin, the Jieshi native, said nobody in the town had become ill from handling the clothing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While many people knew what they were doing was against the rules, they had no other options, he said. 'There is no investment and no factories. If you do not leave and work elsewhere, used clothes is the easiest way of making money.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdmboR0hI9oqqatl5y5pr7SZp%2BarpWjerXB0aeqZqyilrGmedSsnJ1lk6G8tbTErA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-chicks-divorce-songwriting-tour-kelly-clarkson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Chicks' Divorces Taught Them to Write From Real Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nintendo-switch-emulation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nintendo Switch Emulation: What You Need to Know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
