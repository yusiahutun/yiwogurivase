And, ofc, we got the lowdown from board-certified dermatologists <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.instagram.com/drbrendancamp/?hl=en">Dr. Brendan Camp</a> of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/brendan-camp-md>MDCS Dermatology</a> and <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/askdrgraf/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr. Jeannette Graf</a>, Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://icahn.mssm.edu/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mt. Sinai School of Medicine</a>, to help you figure out why your skin is breaking out, and how to choose the <a href=# id=auto-tag_best-sunscreen data-tag=best-sunscreen>best sunscreen</a> formula for your skin and lifestyle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-does-my-sunscreen-make-my-face-break-out><strong>Why does my sunscreen make my face break out?</strong></h2><p>“Sunscreen can clog pores because it sits on the surface of your skin,” Dr. Graf says. The combination of a sunscreen that is formulated with heavy, pore-clogging ingredients mixed with oil, makeup, dirt, and dead skin cells can cause blockages in your pores, which can result in the formation of acne.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-choose-the-best-sunscreen-for-acne-prone-skin>How to choose the best sunscreen for acne-prone skin:</h2><p>S<strong>PF 30 or higher</strong></p><p>For everyday use, our experts reccomend using at least SPF 30. According to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.skincancer.org/blog/ask-the-expert-does-a-high-spf-protect-my-skin-better/#:~:text=The%20SPF%20number%20tells%20you,you%20weren't%20wearing%20sunscreen.">Skin Cancer Foundation</a>, SPF 30 blocks about 97 percent of the sun’s rays, so using a lower SPF than that offers less protection. If you’ll be spending extra time outdoors where you’re more likely to have direct exposure to sunlight, consider using SPF 50 or higher for more protection.</p><p><strong>Consider going oil and fragrance-free</strong></p><p>“Coconut oil, cocoa butter, mineral oil, and waxes like beeswax can potentially clog pores and cause acne,” says Dr. Camp. He recommends looking for sunscreens that are oil-free or contain lightweight, non-comedogenic oils, such as jojoba, sunflower, grapeseed, or rosehip oils.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Graf also suggests considering fragrance-free sunscreens if you have acne-prone skin, as fragrance can be irritating and cause your skin to “produce more oil” than you’d like.</p><p><strong>Look for certain keywords on the label</strong></p><p>We totally get it — not everyone has the time to analyze every single ingredient on the back of the bottle. But make sure to keep an eye out for a few keywords, like “mattifying,” “oil-absorbing,” “pore-minimizing,” “non-shiny,” and “blurring.” They’re often found on the labels, packaging, and/or product descriptions for sunscreens that are formulated with <a href=# id=auto-tag_oily-skin data-tag=oily-skin>oily skin</a> in mind.</p><p><strong>Choose a lightweight formula</strong></p><p>According to our experts, gel sunscreens, sheer cream sunscreens, serum sunscreens, and powder sunscreens are great options for oily skin. But remember — sunscreen in powder form should not be used in place of your regular SPF. “A good rule of thumb is to always use a liquid-based SPF since it provides more broad coverage. Powder formulas are great supplements to a liquid SPF and good to use in between re-applications,” says Dr. Graf.</p><p>Ultimately, the formula you choose — chemical-only, mineral-only, or a hybrid — comes down to personal preference and what feels good on your skin. Mineral sunscreens&nbsp;contain active ingredients zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that absorb extra oil and provide a matte finish, according to Dr. Graf. The ingredients used in <a href=# id=auto-tag_mineral-sunscreen data-tag=mineral-sunscreen>mineral sunscreen</a> are “generally better tolerated and are recommended for those with sensitive skin,” says Dr. Camp, as some filters used in <a href=# id=auto-tag_chemical-sunscreen data-tag=chemical-sunscreen>chemical sunscreen</a> can be a culprit for irritation.</p><p>Chemical sunscreens, which contain ingredients like octisalate, octocrylene, and avobenzone, can sometimes cause breakouts and irritation of acne-prone skin. However, chemical sunscreens tend to feel less heavy or tacky on oily skin, are easier to rub in, last longer if you are sweating or swimming, and don’t leave an ashy, white cast on very deep skin tones like mineral sunscreens can.</p><p>From Neutrogena to EltaMD, Supergoop to Vacation, here are Dr. Camp and Dr. Graf’s top sunscreen picks for people with acne-prone skin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elta-md-cuv-clear-sunscreen.jpeg><p>“This sunscreen is oil-free and contains zinc oxide, which is great for oily skin,” Dr. Graf says, “It also has a light, silky texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.”</p><p>“It also contains niacinamide, a calming ingredient that is great for patients with acne and rosacea-prone skin,” Dr. Camp adds.</p><ul><li><strong>Type:&nbsp;</strong>Chemical (octinoxate) and mineral (zinc oxide)</li><li><strong>SPF:&nbsp;</strong>46</li><li><strong>Oil-free?&nbsp;</strong>Yes</li></ul><p>“Having used this sunscreen for about a year, I can confidently say that it’s a product that has earned its place in my daily skincare routine,” <a href=#>one shopper</a> writes. “Nothing quite compares to the performance of this sunscreen.

But this mineral SPF 50 shields you from the whole UV spectrum and free-radical and pollutant spectrum, helping to prevent lines, age spots, dark spots, and cancer.
