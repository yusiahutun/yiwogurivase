Yes, she did. The sportswoman <a id=https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-veneers href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got veneers</a> a while back. These are thin, tooth-coloured shells attached to the front surface of teeth to improve their appearance.</p><p class=align-left>More recently, she also started <a id=https://celebsdiaries.com/lydia-ko-teeth/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">using Invisalign</a>. Both <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dental procedures</a> are aimed at improving the appearance of the teeth.
