However, there is a lot of misconceptions about what exactly is a socialite, how they earn money, and their job description.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d0512174ffddd049.jpg><p class=align-left>In Kenya, most high profile socialites, including the famous and successful ones are females. Does it mean there are no <a href=# title="famous socialites" rel="nofollow noopener">male socialites</a>? On the contrary, there are many prominent and wealthy men from around the world working as socialites such as Tinsley Mortimer, Scott Disick, Barron Hilton, Jonny Makeup and Oliver Prinz von Anhalt.</p><p class=align-left>You might never have known that male socialites exist because often they are masters of disguise. They use their charms to catch the attention of not only their fans but also those who will fund their money-making ventures. To help understand who is a socialite, how much they are paid and how to enter this career, here is what you need to know.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b359883981f81e1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Many Kenyans Say WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram Outage Good for Family Bonding: "Make it Regular"</span></p></a><h2>What exactly is a socialite?</h2><p class=align-left>The origin of the word socialite can be traced back to the 1920s when it was associated with being socially recognisable and wealthy. According to the <a href=# title="what exactly is a socialite" rel="nofollow noopener">Cambridge dictionary</a>, a socialite is someone from a high-class society famous for attending numerous parties and social events.</p><p class=align-left>The title was often given to royal wives, mistresses, or lovers both male and female. That is why when you look up questions such as "what is another word for socialite?" you are likely to get a wide range of meanings like aristocrat, blue-blooded, swell, noble, gentleperson, magnate and mogul.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Top 10 richest socialites in Kenya</p><p class=align-left>Over the years, the definition has changed because most socialites, mainly from African countries, are not from privileged backgrounds. Such individuals attained fame by posting naked photos, sex videos, or engaging in activities that result in quick riches by any means necessary. Today, socialite characteristics are linked to being wealthy, attaining global reach, and having a vibrant funded lifestyle. But aren't these the things successful influencers have in common?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9274f79b3e8b94e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Express Mixed Reactions Over Mbeere Men Who Share Household Duties With Wives</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Well, the lines have become a bit blurry considering that people with a large following use social media as a brand marketing tool. However, the difference between socialites and influencers is the latter has established credibility in a specific niche hence are considered subject matter experts.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, most people follow a socialite for entertainment purposes and to keep up with their various interests. Not because the individual has credibility or knowledge in a specific niche.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b359883981f81e1.jpg><h2>Can a man be a socialite?</h2><p class=align-left>While there are numerous females with this coveted title, can a man be a socialite? Of course. The emergence of a new breed of socially prominent people should prove to you that if you are aspiring to be a male socialite, there are various role models you can look up to. However, unlike their female counterparts, a man is rarely called a socialite. Instead, they have alternative titles like a political fundraiser, social climber, wannabes, philanthropist, and baller.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4d89567e78ab0719.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of top 10 most toxic fandoms in the world as of 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The main distinction between the two is that a good physical appearance is not mandatory for one to become a male socialite. But the one thing that a female and male socialite have in common is the ability to do anything to sustain their flashy lifestyle and remain relevant.</p><h2>How much do socialites get paid?</h2><p class=align-left>It’s no secret that most socialites are living a comfortable life. They often use their social media to parade sleek cars, expensive outfits, jewellery, and luxurious homes. They frequently fly first class to various destinations including Nigeria, Dubai, China, Europe, USA, China, and many others.</p><p class=align-left>The displayed extravagant lifestyle has made many to wonder where do socialites get their money? Through modelling, advertising, club or event hosting, and attending social events. However, famous socialites like Paris Hilton and Caroline Luef-Brockdorff are born into wealthy families but use their celebrity status to advance their brand or career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f704bcc3573df53_w.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Benjamin Zulu: Marrying religious, overdressed women could put you in perpetual dry spell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The best way to estimate how much socialites in Kenya are paid is to look at the amount Vera Sidika charges. For a single club appearance locally Vera requires a fee of $3,000 or Ksh300, 000 and $6,000 for any event taking place abroad. Generally, it costs a successful socialite around $400,000 per year to maintain their status.</p><h2>What is the difference between a debutante and a socialite?</h2><p class=align-left>With the numerous parties to attend, getting invites to exclusive events, and the amount of money a socialite spends, it’s easy to confuse such an individual with a debutante. Besides, just like in the case of socialites, people also find debutantes a source of fascination.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Vera Sidika hosts lavish barbecue party at her Runda estate alongside comedian Eric Omondi</p><p class=align-left>While you don’t need money, age limit, or qualification to become a socialite, to be a debutante you must be a young woman from a wealthy family. When the girl reaches maturity, she is selected to attend a <a href=# title="famous socialite" rel="nofollow noopener">debutante ball</a> as a way of introducing her formally to society.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9e540943611a3f39_w.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Opinion: Kenya is a beautiful country suffering from deep-seated trust crisis</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A debutante also has an age limit because this rite of passage is for ladies aged 16 to 21 years old. Therefore, while a debutante is focused on tradition and rituals associated with young women, being a socialite is about capitalizing on good looks to become famous and make money.</p><h2>How to become a socialite</h2><p class=align-left>You don't need to be from a wealthy family to become a successful socialite. You can attend the right parties where you will meet someone rich to marry and use their networks to climb the social ladder. If marrying a rich person proves challenging then make sure you are beautiful by the current standards. Next, gain access to high-class social events and get photographed with famous people. Lastly, you must abide by the following rules of being a socialite:</p><ul><li>Commit to none</li><li>Look more fashionable</li><li>Spend money extravagantly</li><li>Get someone to fund your expensive lifestyle</li><li>Have a curvy body that will make a man drool and females envious</li><li>Keep your fans guessing by not revealing all your tricks</li><li>Invest in outfits that leave nothing to the imagination</li><li>Always be camera ready and forget about having a private life</li><li>Be willing to take and post naked photos</li><li>Flaunt your lavish lifestyle shamelessly on social media</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/efa4f5facd63c9a9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dating broke men hoping they'll succeed is a waste of time, Kenyans agree</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You must also be better than your fellow socialites in everything, including having the biggest behind, most expensive wig, house, cars, and jewellery. If it’s still impossible, pick a fellow socialite who is more successful than you and start a feud. Remember to also engage in activities that will make you the most talked-about person because you can easily be replaced or become irrelevant.</p><p class=align-left>Now that you know what exactly is a socialite, how to be one, rules to follow, and the money to charge if you want to be a successful socialite in your generation you must have thick skin. This is because people will scrutinise your life and blogs will write about you, and most times it won’t be in a flattering way. But if you endure all the controversies and somehow your reputation remains intact don’t forget to rub your success in the face of naysayers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f224c47f273a3ecc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 most famous BWWM couples who are cute together</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>Top 25 curvy women on Instagram 2020</li><li>Sexiest woman alive 2020</li><li>10 highest paid female singers in 2020</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlWttcm9drLWiwIyaZKynk56urbXTnmWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./de-zes-beste-spas-in-nederland.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>De zes beste spa's in Nederland om te ontspannen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lack-sensitivity-values-has-left-mulan-lost-translation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Opinion | A lack of sensitivity to values has left Mulan lost in translation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
