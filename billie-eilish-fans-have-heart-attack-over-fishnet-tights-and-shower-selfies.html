She’s now at it again sending fans into overdrive as she posts her edgy outfits and a range of shower selfies.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star has had a busy summer, performing across festivals in Europe and the States, but of course, she still has time for her fans back home as she consistently updates them with her life over on the gram.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1591208030-702x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-eilish-showcases-old-and-new-style>Billie Eilish showcases ‘old and new’ style</h2><p>Taking to her 110 million <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers, the Ocean Eyes singer posted one of her iconic photo dumps, as she showcased her “old & new” style.</p><p>In the first post, Billie posted a picture of her toned legs in fishnet tights and camouflage underpants. Her legs were accentuated with a pair of heeled sneakers, as she showed off her edgy style.</p><p>Throughout the post, the 21-year-old showed off her new red hair transformation, as well as throwing it back to her jet-black long locks.</p><p>In true Eilish style, she showed off her humor in the last slide in a video of herself brushing her teeth and ‘spitting out’ the excess toothpaste. Nice!</p><p>And that wasn’t the end of the bathroom endeavors, as she then took to her Instagram stories to post a range of shower selfies.</p><p>The star had her half-red and half-black hairdo in a wet bun, as she posed for a selfie in the mirror after stepping out of the shower. Her makeup, however, still looks flawless on her face.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-say-they-forget-how-to-breathe>Fans say they ‘forget how to breathe’</h2><p>Upon seeing the photos pop up on their timelines, specifically the front fishnet snaps, fans rushed to the comments to express how ‘breathtaking’ the photos were. So much so, that some even forgot to breathe.</p><p>“First slide finna have me go into cardiac arrest,” penned one.</p><p>Another exclaimed: “Tryna give us heart attacks ?!?!?”</p><p>“Forgot how to breathe please help,” commented another.</p><p>“WHY U KILLING US,” screamed one, while one said: “I CHOKED ON MY BROCCOLI”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-eilish-gets-help-from-fans-after-really-suffering>Billie Eilish gets help from fans after ‘really suffering’</h2><p>Earlier this week, the bad guy singer got help from fans as she announced via social media that she was ‘really suffering’ ahead of her Electric Picnic gig in Ireland.</p><p>Taking to her story before the show, she informed fans: “I am really, really sick, and honestly really suffering,</p><p>“You know me and you know that I wouldn’t cancel a show even if I was like literally dying… (this does feel pretty close lol) but the show must go on.</p><p>“I will see you tonight! But please keep in mind that I am trying my best and I’m gonna need your help tonight. Go hard for me.”</p><p>Of course, fans did go hard for the singer and were seen singing along to her hits more than ever before, as she soldiered on through the performance.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WBcK7IpaOinV2atq210qFkn5meqHqprdWeZKGdkafBbq3TrZico12kw6a%2BjJ%2BgrKCemsFuwMign62rXZa7pXnSoaawnaJiwKa4xaKcrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-pluto-retrograde-affect-each-zodiac-sign.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Pluto Retrograde 2024 Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./show-tolerance-chanting-children-irk-cinemagoers-reciting-lines-while-watching-animated-blockbuster.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Show tolerance: chanting children irk cinemagoers by reciting lines while watching animated bl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
