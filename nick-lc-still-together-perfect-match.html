There’s certainly no stated intent in this show that there is a specific goal. It’s very reflective of where they are in their lives, and they might just be looking for somebody to spend the summer with, or have a fling with — or maybe they are looking for someone who’s a life partner. It’s really up to them to figure out what their own perfect match is.”</p><p>He continued, “Obviously, Valentine’s Day is a holiday that’s rife with symbolism about love. We’re all into the new year, and we’re thinking about our lives and our partners, or lack of partners. These shows are incredibly enjoyable at any time of the year, but I love that we get to see a show like Perfect Match come out on Valentine’s Day.”</p><p>But back to Nick and LC. So…are <a href=# rel=noopener>Nick and LC still together from The Perfect Match</a> season 1? Read on for what we know about if Nick and LC are still together from The Perfect Match season 1 and where they are now since filming ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nick-LC-Perfect-Match-2.jpg><p>Are Nick and LC still together from The Perfect Match season 1? The answer is unclear. Nick and LC were one of five couples in The Perfect Match season 1 finale, along with Dom (The Mole season 1) and Georgia (Too Hot to Handle season 3); Chloe (Too Hot to Handle season 1 and The Circle season 2) and Shayne (Love Is Blind season 2); Bartise (Love Is Blind season 3) and Izzy (Too Hot to Handle season 3); and Joey (The Circle season 1) and Kariselle (<i>Sexy Beasts</i>).</p><p>During The Perfect Match season 1 finale, Nick and LC denied they were the perfect match. “The simple answer is no [we are not the perfect match,” Nick said. “We talked about it, but we can’t say we are the perfect match. I think it’d be ridiculous.” LC added that she “100 percent” agreed. She continued, “I think it would be kind of insane for us to be like, ‘Perfect match! He’s the one!’ I’m not goin to say something I don’t feel is genuine and I’m not going to say it just because we’re here.” While Nick and LC haven’t confirmed their relationship, as of writing this, they both seem to be on good terms. As of writing this, they both follow each other on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nick-Perfect-Match.jpg><p>Who is Nick from The Perfect Match season 1? Nick Uhlenhuth is a 29-year-old from Louisville, Kentucky. He was originally a contestant on The Circle season 3, where he was eliminated in fifth place in the finale. Nick played as himself and as a ghost hunter named “Vince.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Nick-LC-Perfect-Match.jpg><p>Who is LC from The Perfect Match season 1? Lauren “LC” Chamblin is a 29-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia. She was originally a contestant on Love Is Blind season 1. LC listed her job on Love Is Blind season 1 as a “Recruiter/Account Executive.” LC was also a cast member on Love Is Blind season 1’s “After the Altar” special.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nick-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.jpg><p>Who is The Perfect Match host? The Perfect Match season 1 host is Nick Lachey, who also hosts Netflix reality Tv dating shows Love Is Blind and The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On with his wife, Vanessa Lachey. Nick was the lead singer of the boy band 98 Degrees from 1996 to 2012. The group reunited in 2012 and are still together. Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005. Nick is also the winner of season 5 of The Masked Singer&nbsp;during which he performed as the character “Piglet.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Distractify</a> in March 2022, Nick explained that he and Vanessa wanted to host Love Is Blind because of how their own relationship was long distance when they first started dating. “When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally,” Nick said. “When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us <span>Weekly</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined Love Is Blind if he was single. “I would. I mean, it’s fascinating,” he said. “Especially having seen the success of season 1 and seeing two loving couples still married to this day? If I watched that and I was looking for love, why wouldn’t you wanna be a part of that? You know, it’s proven to work!” He added, </span>“This dating world is not one I ever was part of — this very superficial ‘swipe left.’ There’s so much judgment and you can Google everybody. I’m not from that era.”</p><p>The Perfect Match is available to stream on Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Leap-of-Faith-Cameron-Hamilton-Lauren-Speed.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$15.89</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$28.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>43% Off</span></p><p><span class=s1>For more about Love Is Blind, read Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed’s 2021 book,<a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i> Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way</i></span></a></span><span class=s3><i>. </i></span><span class=s1>In the book, Cameron and Lauren, who were one of two couples to marry from <i>Love Is Blind</i> season 1, share their “engaging and accessible love advice for the modern world” and reveal exclusive behind-the-scenes details from the Netflix series and what went down in The Pods that viewers didn’t see. The book is told from Cameron and Lauren’s alternating points of view as the fan-favorite couple dishes on what it was really like to marry a “faceless stranger” on television and opens up about how their relationship shifted—”for better and for worse”—once cameras stopped rolling and Lauren and Cameron’s relationship continued in the real world<i>.
