She explained that people should pay compliments to her stylists, not herself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_76>“I always laugh when thinking about me as [a fashion icon]. I have good people. If I’ve got any kind of fashion sense that’s because of Steve Summers and the other people that dress me,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour</a>, adding, “I just like to shine. I like to be sparkly. I think it goes back to what I said: Everybody should just be themselves. You should be your own individual self and wear whatever makes you feel good.”</p><h2>She recalled a time when she had a very public wardrobe malfunction</h2><p id=par-4_52>At the 1978 CMA Awards, Parton’s signature style was on full display in a tight, glimmering dress. She was nominated for the night’s top honor, the Entertainer of the Year. Just before <a href=#>Johnny Cash</a> and Ronnie Milsap announced that she was the winner, however, she realized that her gown was ripping open.</p><p id=par-5_77>“I remember thinking this is such a beautiful dress, but the fabric is so delicate! I thought, ‘Man, as tight as I wear my clothes…’ – and I was a little hefty then anyway! – I thought, ‘I hope this all holds together!'” Parton told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. “When they called my name, I felt something creeping up my stomach and I thought, ‘Oh My God – my dress is coming apart!’ And I thought, ‘What am I gonna do?'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_7>Luckily, Parton’s seatmates helped her avoid disaster.</p><p id=par-7_33>“Marianne Rogers [Kenny Rogers’ wife at the time] had on a big fur stole and I was sitting down there near her, so I grabbed her stole and held it up,” Parton explained.</p><p id=par-8_21>By the time she got up to the podium, Parton was able to joke about the moment in her acceptance speech.</p><p id=par-9_51>“I had this dress made in case I won and about five minutes ago, I was hoping I wouldn’t win because I busted the front out of it!” she told the crowd. “But my daddy says that’s what I got for putting 50 pounds of mud in a 5 pound bag!'”</p><h2>Dolly Parton doesn’t like to spend that much on her clothes</h2><p id=par-10_26>She may have had her dress made especially for the CMA Awards, but Parton says she typically doesn’t like spending too much money on her clothes.</p><p id=par-11_79>“I think people should do what’s best for them and not try to be fashionable and not try to dress like this one or that one,” she explained. “I’m too stingy to be fashionable. Ain’t no way I’m going to spend the kind of money some people do, to spend $2,000 on one coat when I could buy 14 for the same money and in different colors! I don’t care because I like them, no matter what the cost.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLjLsmSpmaKpvK95z66ZpaGTYrOiv8eipqdllJ7Aor%2FTnqlmmqWowaawjJ%2BpqKakY7W1ucto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./diy-wedding-nails-tips-mistakes-holly-willoughby-manicurist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DIY wedding nails will save you 100s according to Holly Willoughby's manicurist</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-case.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 Cases of 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
