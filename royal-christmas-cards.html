The cards, which date back before Queen Elizabeth II’s childhood, have been around for more than 100 years, and as the royal family grows (2019 welcomed baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor), their Christmas notes only become more and more festive.</p><p>It’s reported that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip send <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">750 to 800 Christmas cards</a> each year. Philip also reportedly sends another 200 cards to various organizations the royal family is close to. And don’t expect each card to have a generic message either. According to Reader’s Digest, the Queen started <a href=#>signing her cards in the summer</a>, so she can have them ready by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">time the holidays roll around</a>. As for what’s on each message, Reader’s Digest reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a different moniker depending on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">recipient of the Christmas card</a>. Politicians and heads of state will receive cards signed with “Elizabeth R” (the R stands for “Regina,” the Latin word for “queen”), while friends will get notes signed with Elizabeth. The Queen’s cousins will receive mailers with her nickname, “Lilibet.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prince-william-kate-middleton-conspiracy-theories.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/king-charles-medical-records.jpg><p>If that isn’t reason enough to believe that the British royal family is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">serious about their holidays</a>, we don’t know what is.
