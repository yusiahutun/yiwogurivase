He was in no condition to object to their presence."</p><p>"It is the Detectives' duty as trained law enforcement officers to realize the critical importance of the moment when a suspect invokes his right to counsel," added the filing. "The burden was not on Mr. Doerman to understand how his demands for counsel triggered the Detectives' duty to stop the interrogation; nor was the burden on Mr. Doerman to resist the Detectives' attempts to keep him talking."</p><p>"The interrogation of Mr. Doerman was over three hours long," his attorney added.

At some point, he allegedly got out of bed, loaded a rifle and shot son Hunter twice. Though his stepdaughter was watching TV in another room during the nap, authorities say she "witnessed the shooting."</p><p>According to the report, the boys' sister saw Doerman chase after one of the children who made a run for it toward a nearby field -- Clayton, 7 -- shooting him and causing him to fall to the ground. Doerman then allegedly shot the child in the head, "at close range."</p><p>As this happened, the young girl is said to have ran back inside the home and picked up the youngest boy, Chase, before she "attempted to flee the residence with him." Doerman, however, allegedly caught up to her, held her at gunpoint and "demanded" she put down the child, which she did as she "begged" him not to shoot her. Doerman allegedly shot at Chase, but his gun didn't fire, so the child ran to his mother. The sister, meanwhile, ran to the fire department and <a href=#><strong>told witnesses her father was "killing everyone."</strong></a></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:db654ac6-545b-4fd9-b892-7c190d882b59 data-container-ref=toofab:article:70625740-be2f-4ade-a6ff-3a3f015ea589 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/05/5by4/2023/06/30/05a216624ae548cb8855124944786b97_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Law&Crime</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New Bodycam Footage Shows Behavior of Father Arrested for Killing Three Sons Just After Arrest</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The two parents then got into a "physical altercation," with Doerman reportedly "going so far as to bite" his wife to get her to drop Chase, per investigators. During the altercation, she is said to have placed her thumb over the barrel of the gun and was shot, causing her to drop the child. Doerman is accused of then fatally shooting the third son, before laying all three boys in the same area on the side of the home.</p><p>According to the docs, he then "sat on the side stoop of the residence and calmly watched [the wife] undertake futile live-saving measures on her three children," who all died from their injuries.</p><p>The docs also claim Doerman told authorities, "I did it. Take me to jail" and said "I shouldn't have done that." They also claim he "admitted to having been thinking about shooting his sons since October" and indicated "that the thoughts of having to kill his sons was so heavy on him that he hadn't slept for three or four days prior" to the murders.</p><p>A hearing for the motion to suppress evidence is set for February; a trial was previously expected for July.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4864db8a-e279-47cf-bc9d-013e99400a62 data-container-ref=toofab:article:70625740-be2f-4ade-a6ff-3a3f015ea589 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/07/5by4/2023/07/17/0738b84e3f274532a107590f0ee697b9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook/Clermont County Sheriff’s Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New Docs Detail How Dad Allegedly Executed Three Sons Amid Wife & Daughter's Attempts to Stop Him</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmbGhfmLWisIydpp6qnZa7brjAsLCeql2ntqi006xkr6Gfoa61scNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./k-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>K-Movies News | South China Morning Post</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nancy-lopez-net-worth-husband-family-age-facts-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nancy Lopez Net Worth, Husband, Family, Age, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
