He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born </a>on March 23, 1964, in Floyd County, Indiana, the United States of America. This means that he is 58 years old as of 2022.</p><p class=align-left>David is a former state trooper of the Indiana State Police. His contentious murder made him famous.</p><h2>What happened to the Camm Family?</h2><p class=align-left>What happened to Jill from the Camm family? David's testimony (which detectives first couldn't believe) recounts what transpired that fateful day. According to him, he returned to his Georgetown, Indiana home after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">basketball practice</a>.</p><p class=align-left>He was welcomed with a horrifying scene of his entire family murdered. His wife, Kim, was on the garage's floor, half-naked and lying in a pool of blood. David's children, five-year-old daughter Jill and seven-year-old son Bradley were slumped inside the SUV. His wife and children were shot execution-style.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jana Reynolds's story: What really happened and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>David got on the phone and requested <a href=#>police officers</a> to come to his house immediately as he shared that his wife and kids were dead.</p><p class=align-left>Also, David thought that his son might still be alive and pulled him out of the SUV and tried to do CPR. When police officers arrived, they found Bradley lying on the floor on top of a prison-issue sweatshirt with DNA from two unknown individuals.</p><h3>The first theory of the crime</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d7cbb9e440b37ced.jpg><p class=align-left>Police started investigating the case and came up with different findings. The case faced numerous hiccups at the beginning with several false leads.</p><p class=align-left>The first theory of the case was that David Camm came home after basketball practice and shot his family. They also stated that he tried cleaning up but stopped and called the Sellersburg State Police post for assistance.</p><p class=align-left>Also, evidence suggested that David Camm had called from his residence at 7:19 pm on the evening of the murder. This was contrary to his statement that mentioned that at the time, he was playing basketball at the church (7:pm to 9:30 pm).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28b1850dc2040714.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dr John Cavaness: The story of the deadly doctor of Eldorado</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another thing that made David Camm a prime suspect for <a href=#>the murder</a> of his family is that he had a history of infidelity, which is often considered a motive for such murders.</p><p class=align-left>However, the evidence considered vital proved to be erroneous as the case progressed. First, the call was made at 6:19 pm, not 7:19, as the investigators indicated earlier. Also, the time of death for the victims based on autopsies was indicated to be around 8:00 pm, earlier than the time specified of 9:30 pm.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the evidence provided by the blood spatter analyst proved to be inaccurate. The <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">DNA evidence </a>at the scene also did not provide any matches.</p><h3>The second theory of the Camm family murders</h3><p class=align-left>After investigators found out that the murder happened an hour earlier, they changed their story. But, of course, since David Camm was not at home, he had an alibi, and eleven people testified that they were with him during basketball practice from 7:00 pm until 9:00 pm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e73516720b7091f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karyn Slover's tragic murder story: What really happened?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, it did not end there; the investigators altered their theory from murder after leaving the basketball court to murder during the basketball game. They claimed that he sneaked out during practice and went back without being noticed.</p><h2>David Camm’s first trial</h2><p class=align-left>In the beginning, investigators concentrated on the evidence on the crime scene and came up with different theories to prove that David Camm <a href=#>was guilty</a>. David's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first trial</a> for the Camm family murders started in 2002 on January 14.</p><p class=align-left>After deliberating for three days, the jury came up with a guilty verdict on March 17, 2002. And David was sentenced to 195 years in prison.</p><h2>David’s second trial</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1fb7d1b158574e0.jpg><p class=align-left>David’s case did not end with the first trial. David Camm’s lawyer filed an appeal in August 2004, and the Indiana Court of Appeals overturned the conviction. The judge claimed that the testimony of women involved with David gave the jury a biased view.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cbc3959961e04aba.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fred Grabbe's story: Background, what happened, and where is he today?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This time, the defence ran the DNA evidence on the grey sweatshirt via CODIS. Again, they found a match, and the genetic material belonged to Charles Boney. Charles was a convicted felon with a history of attacking women and stealing their shoes.</p><p class=align-left>Also, Charles was nicknamed backbone, which matched the name on the sweatshirt. He was arrested in March 2005 and charged with <a href=#>conspiracy to murder</a> after his fingerprints were discovered inside Kim’s SUV.</p><p class=align-left>David's second trial started on January 17, 2006. Even though his conspiracy charge was dropped, he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><h2>Third trial</h2><p class=align-left>David was not content with the case's progress and got another trial after the Indiana Supreme Court reversed his conviction because of speculative evidence. And his third trial started in October 2012.</p><p class=align-left>This time, David was fortunate enough to get a not guilty verdict and absolved him of all the crimes he was accused of. As a result, he was released from prison on October 24, 2013, thirteen years after he first went to prison.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f308b807409bf58.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gavon Ramsay: What happened to the teen who murdered Margaret Douglas?</span></p></a><h2>Who was convicted for the Camm family murders?</h2><p class=align-left>Charles Booney, known as the Camm family backbone, was convicted for the crimes of killing Kim, Jill and Bradley and was sentenced to serve 225 years in prison. However, Charles still maintains that he is not the person that pulled the trigger that fateful day.</p><h2>Where is David Camm now?</h2><p class=align-left>Likely, David Camm returned home to Floyd County, Indiana, after being released from prison. He has taken part in various interviews and been featured in a documentary series called <i>Framed By The Killer </i>that airs on Oxygen.</p><h2>David Camm’s net worth</h2><p class=align-left>After David was acquitted of the Camm murders, he sued Floyd County and the State of Indiana for $30 million. He settled with the county for $450,000.</p><p class=align-left>On top of this, he was sued by his late wife’s parents over an estimated $625,000 he was slated to collect from life insurance and Kim Camm’s 401K fund. So, based on these figures, he is highly likely to be worth a lot even though he spent 13 years in prison.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/61d1c079a0a64c2c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Lori Hayes story: How was Dale Lash arrested and where is he now?</span></p></a><h2>Quick facts about David Camm</h2><li>Where is David Camm now?
