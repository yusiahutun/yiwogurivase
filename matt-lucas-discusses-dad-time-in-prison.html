But in this book, there will be children whose parents or siblings will be in prison this Christmas.&nbsp;</p><p id=egMKjJnHLI></p><p id=eXouIGDseiW data-wc=73>"We don’t think a lot about the prison population. My dad made some mistakes in his business and paid the price. It’s not nice going to visit someone in prison that’s for sure.

He was in prison with murderers and rapists and drug sellers and all that kind of thing and it’s not massively streamlined. There’s open prison and closed prison. He was moved to an open prison after ten days… that’s pretty scary for people… It had changed him, he swore like a trooper when he came out! That dissipated and he didn’t sweat the small stuff anymore. He did the crime and he did the time."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Real reason Matt Lucas left the Great British Bake Off revealed – and where is he now?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5ba3e71452c8-matt-lucas-with-prue-paul-and-noel-on-bake-off.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Real reason Matt Lucas left the Great British Bake Off revealed – and where is he now?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Real reason Matt Lucas left the Great British Bake Off revealed – and where is he now?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Matt Lucas' weight loss journey: How and why the GBBO star lost weight" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9f4182b27500-gettyimages-821338480.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Matt Lucas' weight loss journey: How and why the GBBO star lost weight" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Matt Lucas' weight loss journey: How and why the GBBO star lost weight</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="GBBO Matt Lucas reveals secret behind weight loss - and it’s so simple" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3771c27dbef6-matt-lucas-voyage-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="GBBO Matt Lucas reveals secret behind weight loss - and it’s so simple" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>GBBO Matt Lucas reveals secret behind weight loss - and it’s so simple</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eo4Trg-KybP data-wc=107>Matt also spoke about how his father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 50s, explaining: "I lost my father when I was 22, he died in late November, and that Christmas was hard, and the next one, and the next one.
