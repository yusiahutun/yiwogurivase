however the COVID pandemic had pushed her back into depression.</p><p>On Wednesday, Kaufman County Sheriff's Office confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TooFab</a> that the family had asked for an Amber Alert to be issued, but it didn't meet the criteria because their was "no immediate threat" to the children.</p><p>Per Amber Alert police guidelines, the missing persons must be "at immediate risk of being put in danger," Public Information Officer Jolie Stewart said.</p><p>Situations include being abducted by a non-family member, or a family member who does not have custody and may be intent on harming them, or a suicidal family member, she said.</p><p>She added that Chambers' history of drug abuse would not have automatically triggered an Amber Alert.</p><p>Amber Alerts are named for Amber Hagerman, a nine-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in Arlington, Texas in 1996.</p><p>When triggered, an alert is broadcast to public, internet and satellite radio and television stations; cellphones, billboards and road traffic signs; and social media and search engines; vastly increasing the chances missing persons will be spotted and reported by a member of the public.</p><p>According to the Sheriff's Office, almost everyone who reports a missing person requests an Amber Alert.</p><p>A doorbell camera showed Chambers leaving her house with her daughters, en route to a play date, at 8:06 a.m. on Wednesday.</p><p>CCTV footage shows her pulling into the parking lot shortly after 9 a.m., and switching the engine off.</p><p>Nobody entered, exited or approached the vehicle until 25 hours later, when the three bodies were finally discovered. Temperatures reached highs of 93°F during that time.</p><p>Police have yet to formally confirm the causes of death; however there was no evidence of foul play, no suspect is being sought, and evidence collected at the scene indicated an overdose.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story 7/23/2020 2:32 pm</p><p>A Texas mother and her two children have been found dead in her car in a Dallas parking lot.</p><p>Natalie Chambers, 31, and her daughters Izabel 4, and Elise, 2, had been missing since Wednesday morning, having never turned up for a play date.</p><p>According to Kaufman County Sheriff's Department, the trio left their home in Forney at around 8 a.m., headed to Grapevine, around 43 miles away on the far side of Dallas.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:de7e5110-a274-4e1f-a872-fd8f7bf0c062 data-container-ref=toofab:article:bbb279f1-fbf8-4efa-a22b-727672c3d45c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/5by4/2020/07/23/0fc34ac4b8fe4816971404154251f18c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">AP/NC Lotto/Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">North Carolina $10M Lotto Winner, 52, Charged With Murder of 23-Year-Old Woman</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Natalie's cellphone was last pinged around 1 p.m. near Interstate 635 and Midway Road in Dallas, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WFAA</a> reported.</p><p>When the alarm was raised, police searched overnight, but didn't make the grim discovery until 10 a.m. on Thursday morning.</p><p>Her 2008 blue Ford Escape was found in the Freed's Furniture parking lot off the LBJ Freeway in Farmers Branch, around 13 miles short of her destination, with all three bodies inside.</p><p>Police have yet to reveal the causes of death.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8b718e42-cde3-446b-b709-a62c38556248 data-container-ref=toofab:article:bbb279f1-fbf8-4efa-a22b-727672c3d45c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c3/5by4/2020/07/23/c3511f88145a4e5692365ecfd5a2a3d8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Polk County Sheriff's Office/Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Florida Police Release Chilling CCTV Footage of Suspect Chatting to Victim Minutes Before Fishing Trip Massacre</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Natalie's sister Jessica Purcell told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS DFW</a> in a statement: “Natalie was hilarious and charismatic and never met a stranger.
