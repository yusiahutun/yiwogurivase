The Clash’s Should I Stay or Should I Go was the first song I learnt on guitar, simplest chords ever.</p><p>“But I’m more a Britpop, indie guy. Blur! The first song I got into was Girls & Boys.</p><p>“I can’t get into heavy metal.</p><p>“I can watch the guitarists [like Eddie van Halen and Slash] and think they’re so talented but I could never ever put it on.”</p><p>Arfield was one of five major Ibrox departures at the end of the season just gone.</p><p>After the 2-2 draw against Hearts, the title-winner bid an emotional farewell to the fans alongside Allan McGregor, Alfredo Morelos, Ryan Kent and Filip Helander.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Boss Michael Beale has already snapped-up <a href=#>Kieran Dowell</a> and Dujon Sterling with goalkeeper Jack Butland looking set to follow.</p><p><strong>Keep up to date with ALL the latest news and transfers at the Scottish Sun football page</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zgZdsbGxtX6yuta%2FHZqmappeav7R50pymraxdlr%2BntcSlm2afpZrAtb%2BMrKuupp6asW68xKudqKqdqHq0u82gZLCdlJm2r7OO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cook-review-desperation-road-is-gritty-redemption-tale.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cook review: Desperation Road is gritty redemption tale</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-rodrigo-secret-health-condition-affecting-her-brain-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Olivia Rodrigo reveals secret health condition affecting her brain</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
