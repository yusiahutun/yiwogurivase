When season 2 aired on Netflix, many wanted to know where is Tim Stark now?</p><p>We’ve put together this Tim Stark Bio that covers his whereabouts, his net worth, and details of his wife.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Tiger King’s Tim Stark Now?</strong></h3><p>Tim Stark from Tiger King faced several legal issues that even got him to court. He was taken into custody in April 2021 despite not facing any criminal charges. He was in a long fight to keep Wildlife in Need up and running and to keep the exotic animals that he owned.</p><p>Scott Maples, chief deputy of the Clark County Sheriff’s Department, didn’t make clear elaboration of why he was arrested. But, he stated that Tim was taken into custody for “non-criminal-related concerns.” In 2020, the <strong><a href=#>United States Department of Agriculture</a></strong> (USDA) wrote a 183-page report.</p><p>The report stated that Tim, over the years, had harassed federal inspectors. He also failed to provide veterinary care to some sick or dying animals. Furthermore, he even beat a young leopard to death with a baseball bat. In September 2020, a judge ruled that the Indianapolis Zoological Society will be taking control of all the animals at Wildlife in Need.</p><p>Later, the Indianapolis Zoo was ordered to keep all the animals rescued from Wildlife in Need.</p><p>Tim went on an Instagram live and argued, “I’m demanding that we do a virtual, public hearing,” Stark said. “I want to reason behind your ruling. Now, I know judge, you’re probably thinking, ‘Who in the f*** is Tim Stark to demand anything from the almighty judge? Well, let me introduce you to somebody … I want to introduce you to PETA.”</p><p>The judge who ruled the judgment also shared that when Stark held up his arm, it showed what appeared to be a syringe wrapped around his wrist. While in custody, investigators said that he grabbed and threatened an Indiana deputy attorney general in March during a zoo inspection.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Tiger King’s Tim Stark Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Tiger King’s Tim Stark’s estimated net worth is over $5 million.</p><p>Tim founded the Wildlife in Need in 1999 at his Charlestown home off Jack Teeple Road. For nearly 20 years, Stark and his volunteers showed off the exotic animals for the price of $25 or more. The non-profit business reported $1 million in revenue and over $1.2 million in 2016 alone.</p><p>In June 2021, Tim again made the headlines after the court ordered him to pay more than $700k. PETA won a lawsuit against Wildlife in Need in August 2021 after a judge ruled that Tim’s facility harmed at least 53 big cats. The former veterinarian of the Indiana zoo gave testimony that WIN’s big cats died from the complications of the declawing procedure.</p><p>PETA secured $696,091.11 in attorneys’ fees and expenses and $37,906.59 in costs, totaling $733,997.70.</p><p>Indiana Attorney General’s office file law to shut him down, the judge found there was evidence of embezzlement and misuse of non-profit money. He also lost his license through the USDA to show animals after allegations of animal neglect and abuse. About $50,000 worth of missing animals including a sloth, Debrazza monkeys, and booted macaques, were later found in a closed box truck located on a neighbor’s property outside of the premises.</p><p>Tim is a Silver Creek High School graduate of 1983.</p><p>According to his IMDB, he starred in Louis Theroux: America’s Most Dangerous Pets, Tiger King, and Defending the Kingdom: A Conversation with Tim Stark.</p><p>In April this year, Tim posted a&nbsp;Facebook Live video&nbsp;and claimed he couldn’t “think right mentally anymore.” He was reportedly taken into custody and given a&nbsp;psychiatric evaluation&nbsp;following the two-hour live stream.</p><h3><strong>Tim Stark Wife</strong></h3><p>As of this writing, Tim Star is single. He was previously married to his now-former wife Melissa/Melisa Donn Lane Stark. They were the co-owners of Wildlife in Need. Back in February 2020, Indiana Attorney General filed a lawsuit asking for the dissolving of non-profit.</p><p>The preliminary injunction obstructed Tim and his former wife, Melissa from disposing of any properties belonging to the non-profit.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Tim Stark?</strong></h3><p>Tim Stark was born in the year in 1965.
