Lee put himself on more people’s radar when he announced his intentions to run for office. He was close too, but ultimately lost the election to Kathy Hochul.</p><p>His wife stood firmly beside him through it all. Here’s what we know about her.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Diana_Zeldin_Lee_Zeldins_Wife></span>Who Is Diana Zeldin, Lee Zeldin’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lee Zeldin is <a href=#>happily married</a> to Diana Zeldin, which makes her his wife. Not much is known about her because she prefers to keep to the shadows.&nbsp;There is little known about their relationship, too; however, she is believed to be a practicing Mormon.</p><p>On the other hand, Lee Zeldin is known to be Jewish and a member of the B’nai Israel Reform Temple. Diana Zeldin reportedly met Lee Zeldin more than ten years ago before they eventually walked down the aisle in a private wedding ceremony.</p><p>Despite her affinity for privacy, Diana never misses the chance to encourage and support her husband. She is often seen next to him during public events, and he always stands taller each time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/leezel.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Diana_Zeldin_Kids></span>Diana Zeldin Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lee Zeldin and Diana Zeldin share two daughters, Mikayla and Arianna. They are both said to attend Hebrew school at the Temple.</p><p>The girls are identical twins but were born 14 weeks early and weighed a mere pound and a half.&nbsp;It was difficult for the family, but Lee’s Facebook Post at the time said the girls “fought like champs” despite the odds being “stacked against them.”</p><p>He also wrote: “Two weeks in, the doctors were encouraging Diana and I to let Mikayla go.”</p><p>Thankfully they did not give in, and neither did their girls. They have grown up to be happy and healthy. The family now resides in Shirley, New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/seldin-fotor-20230726132235-768x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Diana_Zeldin_Age></span>Diana Zeldin Age&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her exact age is currently unknown because of how private she is. However, it is believed Diana is currently in her 40s.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Diana_Zeldin_Nationality></span>Diana Zeldin Nationality&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is of American nationality but has a mixed heritage.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Diana_Zeldins_Net_Worth></span>Diana Zeldin’s Net Worth&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lee Zeldin’s Wife, Diana Zeldin, has not made public how much she is worth. However, it is believed that she lives comfortably, partly thanks to her much wealthier husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee’s net worth is estimated to be $2 million. He is considered one of Long Island’s wealthiest Congress members, second only to Senator Charles E. Schumer, who leads by about $4 million in salary.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lee_Zeldin_Diana_Zeldins_Husband></span>Who Is Lee Zeldin, Diana Zeldin’s Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before he became a politician, Lee Zeldin was an American attorney who opened a law practice in Smithtown, New York.&nbsp;Before that, he had served four years of active duty in the US Army. As an attorney, Lee operated the firm full-time until he was elected to the New York State Senate in 2010.</p><p>In 2014, he got elected to the US House of Representatives to represent New York’s First Congressional District. Lee serves on two Committees in the House of Representatives: Financial Services and Foreign Affairs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/zelgg-fotor-20230726132350-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Diana_Zeldins_Husband_Supports_Trumps></span>Diana Zeldin’s Husband Supports Trump’s<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In April 2023, Lee Zeldin raised brows when he revealed that he would <a href=#>support </a>former President Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee tweeted: “The GOP is filled with amazing talent to save our country from the failed policies of the Biden Admin.”&nbsp;He continued, “Our nominee in 2024 will be the 45th & 47th POTUS, Donald Trump. Our economy will be stronger, our streets will be safer, & our lives will be freer. He has my full support!”</p><p>There is nothing new in a Republican expressing support for Trump, but Lee’s revelation stood out because he kept Trump’s name out of his mouth while he ran for governor.&nbsp;This is most likely because Trump is not very popular in New York.</p><p>The only fundraiser he had with the former POTUS happened outside New York.&nbsp;Zeldin’s endorsement heralds his return to the Trump camp at a period when Trump’s 2024 presidential bid looks to be gaining steam.</p><p>Others that have shown support for Trump include <a href=#>Kari Lake</a>, Dana White, and Clint Eastwood.&nbsp;Trump’s stand keeps looking stronger even though he was indicted on charges related to the role he allegedly played in a payoff to an adult film star who claims they may have had a genital meet and greet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krq24jLCcZqOepMRurcGorK1llJ6ur62Ms5ylnJmjeq2xxGaxnqSUnru0edainZ5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./65d7656e268e3e356d8b45f9-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Europa League 2023: Dnde ver Roma vs. Feyenoord vuelta: a qu hora juega Santi Gimnez, pronst</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-travis-kelces-ex-kayla-nicole-taylor-swift-savage-x-fenty-model-dated-nfl-star-and-5-years-so.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Travis Kelces ex, Kayla Nicole?
