But if there's one essential we know to invest in, it's a good pair of black pants. "Black trousers are such a staple in a woman's wardrobe, from the office to a night out," says Dani Michelle, the celebrity stylist behind the looks of the Kardashians and Jenners. Today's pants go beyond classic slacks to leather and linen options with each being just as versatile as the last. When researching the best black work pants, we looked for designs that can be worn in numerous ways, come in a wide range of sizes and lengths, and are easy to care for (meaning wrinkle-resistant and machine washable fabrics). We spoke to three experts and tried a few pairs ourselves to determine what deserves to be called the best.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-j-crew-kate-straight-leg-pant-in-bi-stretch-cotton></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.

The straight, slightly cropped leg is not too tight nor too loose and pairs nicely with a variety of tops and shoes. The style features the brand's signature front-perfecting pockets, which create a smooth, sculpted look. Made from responsibly grown cotton, the fabric is stretchy and breathable and can be machine washed, so you don't have to worry about racking up a hefty dry cleaning bill. They come in regular, tall, and petite sizing meaning no hemming is required.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-24, tall and petite available | <strong>Materials: </strong>Cotton, viscose, elastane |<strong> Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hm-tapered-linen-blend-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M Tapered Linen-Blend Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1346 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M Tapered Linen-Blend Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NFXIx_D9RecOqbGHhYzZ9m23kLk=/fit-in/1500x1346/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-24at4.22.01PM-6b9fce445dce4f3ea49d774a0398976c.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of H&M</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Besides fitting in with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coastal grandma aesthetic</a>, as a lightweight fabric, linen will keep you cool during heat waves, especially on a commute to your office via sweaty, packed in subways. But to keep it from wrinkling too much, find one mixed with another fabric, like this pair from H&M, which has a splash of rayon in it. Of course, we’re fans of the high-waist, but we also like the tapered fit on this pair that ends in a slight crop instead of your traditional straight leg. The sleekness will elevate your office attire, and to take it one step further, we recommend trying the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching blazer</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 0-26 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Rayon, linen | <strong>Rise:</strong> High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-the-row-marce-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Row Marce Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Row Marce Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j-mYcayhMCh-D3q1tS7DmU6mgPU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-row-marce-pant-a5aa2db50c504ba3b8806cc27311d4ab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-A-Porter</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, these look like your standard black trouser, but we promise they’re worth the hefty price tag. We love the subtle, luxury details in this pant, such as the perfectly crafted front pleats, which elongate the leg and draw the eye up. The slouchy, extra long hem also gives a bit of a borrowed-from-the-boys flair — almost as if you reimagined a vintage menswear suit — that completely covers the shoe. But aside from the design, take a look at the fabric, for instance: it’s a luxury combination of virgin wool, mohair, and cotton. The trio results in pants that are stretchy, not too loose, and lightweight, but at the same time, they are not too breezy. It offers the right amount of slouch and breathability to wear year-round — and we think the amount of ways you can style this make it worth the price, too. Add a pair of heels to flatter the longer hem and appear a bit more formal for any important meeting or try a pair of shearling lined loafers for a true menswear-inspired look.

Though these pants are technically jeans, the wide silhouette and brushed denim make them look just as polished as trousers. The Turkish two-way stretch cotton is stretchy and comfortable, which is ideal when sitting in the office all day. For anyone that has started their workday with perfectly crisp pants only to walk out with wrinkles, you will rejoice knowing these pants are wrinkle-resistant. And we can't get over the concealed snap in the hem that lets you adjust the length of the pants. You can hem them for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flats during the day</a> and roll them down when wearing heels to happy hour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 0P-18 | <strong>Materials: </strong>Cotton, elastane |<strong> Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-eloquii-the-ultimate-suit-pintuck-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eloquii Ultimate Suit Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Eloquii The Ultimate Suit Pintuck Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mF0xjchpj08lBoEciXOtp0nlxjo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign87-fc6f7894226044dfb4ea8cd517451f73.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eloquii</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>There are no belt hoops.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These sharp pintuck pants from Eloquii look professional, but because they have a fit that almost feels custom-made — it comes in three different inseams (25-inch, 27-inch, and 29-inch) and plenty of stretch to mold to your figure — they'll feel more comfortable than your typical work pants. Just be aware that it has no belt loops, so you'll need to make sure it fits you well in the waist. But they don't gap at the waist, which is a common problem many curvy women, especially those with larger hips and a booty, experience, negating the need for a belt. And while we know sometimes the more spandex included in a pant, the cheaper they feel (or they just don't last quite as long), this still feels thick without being bulky. They hit just at the ankle, too, giving you the opportunity to pair it with chic shoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 14-32, tall and short available | <strong>Materials:</strong> Rayon, nylon, spandex |<strong> Rise: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-petite-studio-maven-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Petite Studio Maven Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Petite Studio Maven Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cvzdlBlnx2j66MV4fY4KNfUjZz8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/petite-studio-maven-pants-176e4baaa8124e86ae804b7bfb88f652.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Petite Studio</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone who is five-foot-four or under knows that shopping for work pants can be a nightmare. And when we do find the right pair, investing in a seamstress to adjust the garment length is a task on its own. That’s why we adore <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>petite brands</a>, like Petite Studio, which designs clothing catered towards this height range. These slim yet stretchy trousers, in particular, are designed to sit high on the waist and drape along the legs on shorter heights for an illusion of a taller silhouette. The rest of the pants are classically tailored, but have a laid-back design with the side slits (that you can fasten or wear open) on each leg. Our only complaint? We wish the size range catered towards curvy petites.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-L | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Rise:</strong> High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-madewell-the-tall-harlow-wide-leg-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell The Tall Harlow Wide-Leg Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Tall Harlow Wide-Leg Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R6GFGSMSrROS7IsDnt0XTKcyemk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-the-tall-harlow-wide-leg-pant-91f18c944d6449d389ce651f510e78d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>The sizing runs big.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tall women tend to have just as much difficulty as petite women when finding pants that fit. But if a pair of pants is too short, there’s not much you can do — you just have to rock with the accidental cropped fit. Because everyone deserves to find a pair that fits them as advertised, and not a few inches too short at the leg, we suggest this pair from Madewell, which offers every kind of fit, including tall. The straight, sailor-inspired leg on these pants have a 33-inch inseam, allowing you to relax about whether or not these will appear too short. The high-waist and wide leg will also further accentuate your long legs and height. We appreciate that these are relatively summer-friendly, too, since they’re a cotton, linen, and tencel blend, which are all lightweight, breathable fabrics that won’t cling to your body and allow lots of airflow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-16 | <strong>Materials:</strong> Tencel, lyocell, cotton, linen | <strong>Rise:</strong> High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-split-hem-reformation-fletcher-pant-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Split Hem</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Fletcher Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Fletcher Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5AH_zOWEJXLTMbMd95UNBf4Tw0Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign84-3d55ad35bc3e456db4e9f118334dc1f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slit pants are all the rage recently, and while they are very fitting for the dance floor, this pair from Reformation is classy enough to still wear to work. The pants have a straight fit and a short split hem that shows off just the right amount of skin. What is the point of having a slit in your pants, you ask? It's great at showcasing your footwear, whether that's a heel, boot, or sneaker. Crafted in Los Angeles, these pants were made with less water and carbon dioxide waste. Do note though that it's recommended you hand wash them.

Because high-waisted pants elongate the leg, we recommend this for anyone who is on the shorter side, too, since it also comes in petite sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 0-20, petite available | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, spandex | <strong>Rise:</strong> High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wool-jcrew-cameron-slim-cropped-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wool</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Cameron Slim Cropped Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1396 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Cameron Slim Cropped Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eYfzS1w30Avkl_t2cnxH1A2QwFI=/fit-in/1500x1396/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-03-24at4.15.03PM-72f454da36b944439c762157e45a96a7.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of J.Crew</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only does wool have an elegance to it that's perfect for the office, but it's breathable, wrinkle-resistant, and helps you regulate your temperature no matter if it's hot or cold. You can enjoy all the benefits of the fabric in J.Crew's version. The slim-fit, cropped leg cut holds you in, contours your waist, and slightly lifts the behind with all the softness from the wool. The wool is sourced from one of Italy’s oldest mills and has a bit of elastane mixed in for added stretch and comfort. Throw on one of the brand’s matching blazers, including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Parke Blazer</a> (which we named our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>best overall blazer for women</a>) with the same fabric blend, for a borrowed-from-the-boys look, and pair with a classic flat or heeled sandal to show off the ankles.

The wide leg in this style balances out your hips and gives off a flirty vibe while the knife pleats keep it polished. Made from crepette, a drapey, crepe fabric with a matte finish, these pants are super comfortable and look more expensive than they are. Those that are tall or short know that "cropped" pants can turn out either too short or long, so Aritzia offers this style in regular, tall, and short inseams for your true cropped fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-16, tall and short available | <strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester |<strong> Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-jogger-athleta-brooklyn-ankle-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Jogger</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Brooklyn Ankle Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Brooklyn Ankle Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sx5NBhzcz9z9rNMOg_59BaBDaXg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign51-adfb494dbbb74e7e82bdcc0fbbaf7379.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Maybe you're going to work on a casual Friday or traveling for a business trip, but when you want pants that are a little more casual, these joggers from Athleta fit the bill. Made from recycled polyester, the pants are super stretchy and lightweight, yet the tapered leg can be dressed up or down. They are perfect for traveling because they are packable, wrinkle-resistant, and offer UPF 50+, protecting your skin when running around a city. Plus two zip pockets let you store any essentials safely. Simply tuck a white top or bodysuit inside the rib knit waistband for a quick, put-together look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> 00-26, tall and petite available | <strong>Materials:</strong> Recycled polyester, spandex |<strong> Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-wilfred-the-melina-pant-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wilfred The Melina Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aritizia Wilfred The Melina Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/z6bTT3iax1zV6xWhmpLwWThiE6U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign81-dc237afea87d434bbddebb7dbc66a69a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They run small.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leather pants are beloved by the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan and while they are great for going out, they can be a fierce variation on black work pants too. With its straight leg, high-rise, and subtle sheen, Aritzia's vegan version is as appropriate in the office as at the bar. Designed like jeans, the pants have five-pocket styling, including wide-set back pockets that give some oomph to your backside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Need some outfit inspiration? Take a cue from celebrity stylist Solange Franklin.

Reviewers say the design is great for bigger behinds as the loose leg fits your curves and the tie front highlights your waist. Celebrities like Kendall Jenner and Lupita Nyong'o are fans of the pant style and demonstrate how it goes with just about anything, from cropped sweaters to lacy camisoles to plain tees. With more than 30 colors beyond black, you'll be tempted to stock up on a few shades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-3X | <strong>Materials:</strong> Polyester, spandex |<strong> Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shaping-spanx-the-perfect-pant-hi-rise-flare-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shaping</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx The Perfect Pant, Hi-Rise Flare</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx The Perfect Pant, Hi-Rise Flare, " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RKn6fCtEAnavUUqtjOJ860oMy30=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign80-646854ffcdce4d748e3f573c88f57e3c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They don't have pockets.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You know Spanx for its iconic shapewear, and with its Perfect Pant, you can harness all its shaping power in stylish pant.

While choosing a silhouette comes down to your personal preference and style, Michelle has some tips. "For loose pants, I always look for a front pleated trouser. I think the pleats help create a small waist and drop nicely around your curves," says Michelle. "For fitted pants, I like to make sure that it's tight around the thigh or knee down. What I dislike most is something not being here nor there. It should be flowy or fitted, not in-between." Hines thinks the shoe you wear can also help “determine the full silhouette of the look” because the shoe, such as a heel or pointed loafer, can further elongate your legs and enhance the style you choose.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Certain fabrics are better for certain seasons and occasions. Wool is a great choice for the winter when you want to stay warm and cozy, while linen is good for hot months. Faux leather is a bit more edgy and can multitask as a going out pant as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You also may want to look for fabrics that have some stretch, so the pants stay comfortable and retain their shape throughout the day<strong>,</strong> including jersey and nylon, which are favorites of Mays. Wrinkle-resistant fabrics are also key, and one the stylist recommends to avoid for this reason is “classic cotton twill.” Nothing is worse than standing up from your desk to find your pants covered in unintentional wrinkles.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Care</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unless you don't mind running to the dry cleaners every time your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work pants</a> get dirty, you want to look for machine washable styles to save you time and money. Thankfully, more brands offer work clothes that can be washed at home. And depending on the label and item, you<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> don't always have to follow the "dry clean only" instructions</a>.

"With front pleat trousers, you have so much freedom. It can be a tucked-in loose top, or something more fitted, and let the pants take the lead on volume," says Michelle. "With fitted pants, I lean into a looser top so that I don't feel the body is overexposed, and really sit into the comfort and silhouette you're pulling off." Kendall Jenner, one of Michelle's clients, is known for sporting black trousers with vests, crop tops, cardigans, blazers, and oversized button-downs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to footwear, Michelle, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">created a spring shoe edit with DSW</a>, says you can't go wrong with a closed-toe heel for the office though you can also play with contrast.

A suit with a sneaker gives instant cool.” Another option she recommends is loafers, especially a vintage pair, for “a little personality.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although Hines suggests brogues and derbies for his male clients, these styles “work well as the silhouette of work pants” for women, too, because they tend to have a slim or standard fit, and “stylistically work for regardless of career.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Cieslak</a> is the Assistant Commerce Editor at InStyle, covering the latest trends and providing styling advice to readers.
