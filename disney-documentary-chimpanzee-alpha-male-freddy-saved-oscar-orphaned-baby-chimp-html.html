It was very unusual.'<br></span></p><p><span>The project took 700 days of filming over three-and-a-half years and the crew endured a host of obstacles, including swarms of aggressive bees, torrential rain, extreme humidity and deadly snakes.<br></span></p><p><span>They at first followed a different chimpanzee mother and baby, but when the crew came across Isha and her newborn Oscar, they knew they had found a special chimp.<br></span></p><p><span>‘Almost as soon as he was born, Oscar was bouncing around doing all this look-at-me stuff. He wrote himself into the script. But we had no idea he’d have such an eventful life.’</span></p><p><span>An older mum with seemingly unlimited patience, Isha nuzzles Oscar with chimpanzee kisses in the film, tucks him up safely at night in a hammock of branches high in the trees, and makes a start on his education.</span></p><p><span>For thousands of years, the chimps of the Taï Forest have used a sophisticated technique to crack their favourite walnut-like cola nuts, handing their unique skill down through generations.</span>&nbsp;</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/21/article-2312483-196A23BF000005DC-159_634x354.jpg height=354 width=634 alt="Helping hand: Freddy cracks open nuts for the orphaned Oscar" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Helping hand: Freddy cracks open nuts for the orphaned Oscar</p><p><span>They use tree roots as anvils and carry heavy stone hammers for miles through the forest.</span><br></p><p><span>‘One of the funniest things is seeing little ones like Oscar trying to learn, because they keep getting it wrong,’ Linfield says. ‘They miss the nut and hit their foot instead.
