Chris Cross was one of the founding members, before the group changed their name to Ultravox. Forming in 1974 as Tiger Lily, they had singer Dennis Leigh as the frontman, as well as Stevie Shears on guitar, Warren Cann on drums and Billy Currie who played violin and keyboard.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ultravox-s-chris-cross-dies>Ultravox’s Chris Cross dies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-156883087.jpg><p>Frontman Midge Ure paid tribute to Chris on Facebook.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> wrote: “We worked together, we played together, made <a href=#>music</a> and directed videos together. We were instant friends as well as Ultravox comrades.</p><p>“Even after years apart, we managed to pick up where we left off like the years in between never existed.</p><p>“You were the glue that held the band together. You were the logic in the madness, and the madness in our lives. It was great to know and grow with you.</p><p>“You are loved and missed old friend”.</p><p>Cross’ cause of death has not been shared.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-band-changed-several-times-throughout-the-years>The band changed several times throughout the years</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In 1976, the band changed their name to Ultravox and released three albums in the next two years. These were called Ultravox!, Ha!-Ha! and Systems of Romance. Although none of the records hit mainstream charts, they had a devoted following.</p><p>Midge Ure came on board to join Chris Cross and Ultravox in 1979, after guitarist Robin Simon and lead singer John Foxx left.</p><p>They got to work on their breakthrough album, Vienna, and it was released in July 1980.</p><p>The single with the same name was released in the following January and spent four weeks at number two in the charts. It became the fifth best-selling single in the UK that year.</p><p>Midge Ure also paired up with Sir Bob Geldog to co-found the Band Aid video which cemented itself into history. Ultravox’s Chris Cross also worked on projects outside the group, collaborating with Ure by directing music videos, such as Bananarama’s Shy Boy.</p><p>They released five more albums throughout the 1980s, Rage in Eden, Quartet, Monument, Lament and U-Vox.</p><p>They went their own ways for a number of years, but reunited in 2009 for a tour.</p><p>In 2012 Ultravox released its final record, Brilliant, and Chris Cross was co-writer on all songs alongside Ure and Currie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-pay-tribute-to-ultravox-s-chris-cross>Fans pay tribute to Ultravox’s Chris Cross</h2><p>Fans have taken to social media to pay tribute to the star.</p><p>One wrote on Twitter: “So sorry for your loss Midge. Chris and you guys were the soundtrack of my youth, and still love you guys to bits.”</p><p>“Huge shock and loss. Deepest sympathy to Chris’s family and friends,” wrote another.</p><p>A second said: “That’s sad about Chris Cross. I interviewed all of Ultravox separately across one day once, and Chris stuck out as the least Ultravoxy. For all their success – and probably because of it – they’re definitely underrated.”</p><p>While a third penned: “Devastated to learn of the death of Chris Cross, bass player from Ultravox. Rest in peace, guy.”</p><p>And a fourth added: “Saddened to hear of the passing of Chris Cross who was in the legendary Ultravox and co wrote the iconic song Vienna sending condolences to his family and friends Rest in Peace Chris Cross.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2V%2FcLnUrKCcZaOprrN5wqGpoqtdmL%2Bwv9Jmm6Kdo2KutHnUpaurmaakxbR5zKKboJ1dqr%2Bmec%2BasKxlpKe2o8HTnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teddi-mellencamp-says-she-believed-she-was-going-through-menopause-after-adverse-side-effects-from-iud.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teddi Mellencamp Believed She Was Going Through Menopause After Adverse Side Effects From IUD</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./majestic-and-moist-honey-cake.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>majestic and moist honeycake</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
