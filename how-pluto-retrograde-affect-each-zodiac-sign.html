If you’re wondering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how Pluto retrograde 2024 will affect each zodiac sign</a>, keep in mind that this transit will impact not only you as an individual, but all of us as a collective.</p><p>The word <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>“retrograde”</a> can inspire fear, terror, and malaise. It conjures memories of delayed flights, texts from your toxic ex, and generally confusing times in your life. However, not all retrogrades are created equally, and each planetary retrograde will affect you in a completely unique way.</p><p>For example—inner planetary retrogrades will always impact your day-to-day life on a much more profound frequency. The inner planets include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercury, Venus, and Mars</a>, as these celestial bodies influence your personality and your relationships on a more immediate level. And because these retrogrades never last more than a few weeks, they tend to strike your life with more force and intensity. However, when an outer planet stations retrograde, you might not even notice it at first. The outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—tend to represent larger trends of your life, as they move much more slowly and their retrogrades can last several months. These planets are already retrograde around 50 percent of the time, but by the time they are over, you’ll notice all the massive changes that took place over this longer period of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-14.png><p>Beginning on May 2 at 1:47 p.m. ET, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pluto stations retrograde</a> at 2 degrees of Aquarius and stations direct on October 11 at 29 degrees of Capricorn. This time around, Pluto retrograde could coincide with major political upheavals and societal shifts, as it will bring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pluto back into Capricorn</a> for the last time as of September 1. It will not return to Capricorn for another 248 years, as we are now gearing up for all that Pluto in Aquarius has in store for you as an individual and us as a collective.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>Pluto retrograde begins on May 2 at 2 degrees of Aquarius and ends on October 11 at 29 degrees of Capricorn.</p></figure><p>Pluto is the planet of creation and destruction, as well as death and rebirth. This is the slowest moving planet in astrology, evoking generational shifts and gradual changes that evolve over time. And as Pluto retrogrades from the beginning of Aquarius to the end of Capricorn, you may notice a resurrection of certain issues that we haven’t entirely dealt with or moved away from. Capricorn is a cardinal earth sign of hierarchy, wealth, ambition, and tradition, which is why this retrograde could represent the last dying breath of power structures that no longer have a place in our future. And because this retrograde ends at 29 degrees—a.k.a. the “anaretic degree”—it could coincide with a major turning point for society as a whole. Adversely, Aquarius is the zodiac sign of community effort, innovation, revolution, and futurism, which is why this retrograde will also give us time to process some of the strange societal experiments we’ve been introduced to during this transit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-pluto-retrograde-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How Pluto Retrograde Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>This retrograde will have the biggest impact on our overall collective, but it will also affect you as an individual.
