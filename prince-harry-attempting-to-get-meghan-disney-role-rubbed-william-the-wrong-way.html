A particular clip from January of the same year, where Prince Harry was praising his wife Meghan Markle to Disney CEO Bob Iger at the Lion King premiere, had attracted criticism. Insiders close to the Firm claimed that the Queen found it ‘cringe.’</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Along with the late Queen, <a href=#>Prince William</a> was also ‘against the idea’ of Harry pitching his wife to someone for a Disney gig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1129888189-1024x898.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-s-attempt-to-get-meghan-disney-role-created-tension-between-royal-family-members>Harry’s attempt to get Meghan ‘Disney role’ created tension between royal family members</h2><p>Royal experts Dylan Howard with Andy Tillett reveal details of how the clash between Prince William and Prince Harry further increased in their book <a href=#>Royals</a> At War. According to the experts, royals including <a href=#>the Queen</a> and William were uncomfortable finding out that Prince Harry was talking about Meghan being ‘really interested’ in Disney voiceovers to the CEO Bob Iger.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">clip</a>, Harry is seen telling Bob: “You know she does voiceovers,” to which Bob says, “Oh, really?”</p><p>Harry continues: “Did you know that?” and the latter replies “Ah, I did not know that.” Harry smiles and tells him, “You seem surprised,” pointing briefly at Meghan, who was standing right next to them, chatting with Beyoncé and Jay-Z.</p><p>Harry added: “But yeah, she’s really interested.” “Sure,” Bob replied. “We’d love to try.”</p><p>The clip caused more criticism for Harry and Meghan as a source close to Buckingham Palace revealed: “For the Queen, there’s an element of cringe factor. To watch Harry groveling to the boss of Disney is nothing short of uncouth. She is embarrassed at this debacle. How could she not be asking herself, ‘Why are members of my family selling themselves off to the highest bidder?'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-515590058-1-819x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-found-it-tacky>Prince William found it ‘tacky’</h2><p>The Queen was not the only one who found it ‘cringe.’ Sources further alleged that even Prince William is ‘firmly’ against the idea of Harry trying hard to get Meghan a Disney job.</p><p>“William has always thought it’d be tacky and he knew he’d have the support of the Queen in this opinion,” the source claimed.</p><p>“Everyone was worried this will spark a new chapter in <a href=#>Harry and William’s clash</a> over Meghan,” the source added as the Disney drama unfolded.</p><p>However, later reports showed that Meghan Markle recorded the voiceover for Disneynature’s new film Elephants in the autumn of 2019 as the former <a href=#>TV</a> star was approached by filmmakers, Mark and Vanessa Berlowitz, earlier that summer.</p><p>Meghan had been a Disney enthusiast and she was aware of the film for a while. She had seen some footage that was taken over a few years, so the team considered her a perfect fit for the voiceover role.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aEcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYrayVor21tc2gZK2nXZyytXnMnp6hmZ5isaq%2FzZ6wZqqfobJuvtSbmZ6cXay2rbjImqRmrJiaeri%2BzqeeZq%2BRrnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-m-ready-extreme-taylor-swift-explains-bizarre-harness-accessory-fans-question-fashion-choice-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift explains harness accessory as fans question her fashion choice</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./post-punk-artist-the-soft-moon-and-techno-pioneer-silent-servant-found-dead-at-ages-44-and-46.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Post-Punk Artist The Soft Moon and Techno Pioneer Silent Servant Found Dead At Ages 44 And 46</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
