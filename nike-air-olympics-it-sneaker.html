Nike was hosting a design workshop with upcycling and vintage organization Collectivo Paris, and designer Lola of K’Raba Studio was showing me how to deck out my new kicks with small silver hoops.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brand had tasked Lola with reenvisioning one of the classic Nike Air silhouettes. Her solution: to loop chunky pieces of metal around the laces and punch as many holes through the fabric as possible, mimicking the maximalist, over-layered jewelry aesthetic that has become her signature. “I love,” she told me, “these two different feelings.” To her, there was undeniable synergy between the sporty feeling of the shoe and the punkness of the piercing. It was a reflection of how she dresses.</p><img alt="a glass bowl on a table" title="a glass bowl on a table" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-3812-66203ea31103d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Tara Gonzalez</span><p>A custom Nike Air sneaker designed by Lola of K’Raba Studio</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The day before, I’d sat with Nike’s lead footwear designer for lifestyle innovation, Juliana Sagat, to discuss how she juggles fashion and sport when creating footwear. “I think about expression and experience,” she said. “Of course we want the shoe to be comfortable, but we want it to be stylish as well.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sagat has been seeing a new sporty aesthetic on the streets of Paris in anticipation of this summer’s Olympic Games, which the capital is hosting. French girls like to “mix something very classy with something sporty,” she said. “In Paris, you live a hectic life, so you don’t have time to change. You want to be able to dress for work, for drinks with friends, for a party.” Her outfit felt like proof of concept: She was wearing a light blue Martine Rose x Nike football jersey, and in her curly hair were silver hairpins adorned with dangling thick heart bobbles that echoed the chunkiness of her hoop earrings. On her feet were the Nike Air Max TNs I’d customized.</p><img alt="a woman wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses" title="a woman wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses" width=3283 height=4103 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/a-ja-wilson-66211fc63a15b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">NIKE</span><p>WNBA player A’ja Wilson in a custom Nike look and a pair of Nike Airs</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sagat and Lola—along with over 40 Nike athletes, from gymnast Jordan Chiles to sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46753120/serena-william-post-baby-bikini-photo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Serena Williams" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Serena Williams</a>—were in Paris to celebrate the unveiling of Nike’s 2024 Olympic kits. At the “Nike On Air” show last Thursday, a handful of athletes took the stage for a presentation that highlighted what competitors will be wearing on the track and pitch this July, and celebrated the innovation of Nike Air technology. To get to the stage, guests walked through Air immersion rooms, taking in the history of Nike Air and discovering what the brand has designed for this summer’s athletes.</p><img alt="a group of people on a stage" title="a group of people on a stage" width=3200 height=1837 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/019-nikeonair-federation-66203de1ba62f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nike</span><p>Nike’s athletes competing in this year’s Olympics modeled the 2024 kits at the brand’s On Air event in Paris on April 11.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nike has been known for its Air technology, which has helped athletes get faster than ever, for a long time now. But the brand is also known for creating the kind of sneakers that people who’ve never dreamed of gold medals or set foot on a track want to wear. From a fashion perspective—that is to say, my perspective—the design is as interesting as the tech.</p><img alt="a person in a garment" title="a person in a garment" width=4480 height=5601 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jordan-chiles-3-6621201eafa52.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nike</span><p>Gymnast Jordan Chiles in her Nike Airs</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the show, all the guests were welcomed onstage to learn more about a particularly unusual design experiment—the Athlete-Imagined Revolution, or A.I.R. project—in which Nike’s creative team collaborated with 13 athletes to reenvision the sneaker—not for competition, but for a dream world. To kick off the process, the Nike Sport Research Lab spoke with athletes and then used generative AI to produce hundreds of images per shoe, before honing in on what worked best for each one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Along with a handful of other fashion editors, I found myself hovering over Sha’Carri Richardson’s iteration, which featured the white fabric of the sneaker woven around an invisible leg like the fabric ribbons of a Miu Miu ballet flat. French soccer player Kylian Mbappé’s looked like a sleek platform wedge without the heel. British sprinter Dina Asher-Smith’s featured a silver sliver that curved like a springboard sole. While these shoes were built for a life none of us live, it all still felt like evidence that Nike Air’s DNA is rife for disruption—and versatile enough to handle it.</p><img alt="a group of airplanes" title="a group of airplanes" width=1920 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/air-finalconcepts-group-2001-66203e04bc8ac.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nike</span><p>All 13 sneakers from Nike’s A.I.R. project</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The morning after the show, following the design workshop, I put on my customized pierced Nike Air sneakers to take a walk. I saw chic Parisians in worn-in Air Max Plus Drifts, kicking up their feet at an outdoor breakfast table and smoking cigarettes. A runner in tiny track shorts sprinted past me in the Nike Air Pegasus 40. A few hours later, someone tapped me on a shoulder at a vintage shop to ask where my Nike Airs were from, before pointing out the almost-matching, unpierced pair on her feet.</p><img alt="a man wearing a blue jacket and black boots" title="a man wearing a blue jacket and black boots" width=4049 height=5061 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/athing-mu-1-66212097bc085.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nike</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the Olympics approach, it feels self-evident to me that a new It shoe is in the making. Whether the sneaker is worn for city life or built for performance, Nike Air will be all over the streets and on our screens before we know it.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Nike Air Sneakers<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
