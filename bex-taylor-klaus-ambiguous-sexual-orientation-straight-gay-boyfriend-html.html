A good looking woman, Bex,&nbsp;appears somewhat in "Tom Boy" style, with her small height, petite physique, and plain body curves. "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Killing</a>" star who appears in a controversial role as Bullet, describes her character on screen as:</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Yes, I am a straight girl who plays a gay character on TV. No, I am not ashamed. The point of Bullet is not that she is gay. There is so much to her and I look up to the strength and determination this girl has. I get the beautiful opportunity to play a character I can admire and learn from on a daily basis. Bullet knows who she is and can accept herself for it all, even if others can't or won't."

She revealed that she was gay all along and then linked her YouNow stream where fans got to chat with her and her choice to reveal her sexual orientation.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On her Livestream she talked about how she felt about hiding this fact about for such long time and how it hurt her every time she stated that she was straight, calling it as "feeling wrong."&nbsp;One beloved fan asked if she was scared to come out right now to which Bex responded by saying</p><p>Terrified, absolutely terrified. Part of why I’m coing out is because there’s so much hate and fear in and around the LGBT community right now and it’s important for us not to halt progress out of fear. Yes, it’s a scary time, but we need to stand up and say, even if you are afraid, I’m not afraid, or even if I&nbsp;amafraid, I’m strong. I am who I am and you can’t take that away from me.</p><p>She also talked about sharing her choice in partner's gender with her parents and family stating</p><p>I came out to my family very awkwardly at Thanksgiving once,&nbsp;That was fun.
