The TV star shared updates on her recovery and details about her condition in a candid Instagram post on Thursday, March 30. </span><b>Scroll below for more details on what happened to Carrie Ann.</b></p><h2><b>What Happened to Carrie Ann Inaba?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Carrie Ann shared clips from her four-night stay in the hospital after facing a scary illness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Special shout-out to the wonderful staff of doctors, nurses and aides at @cedarssinai for taking such good care of me,” her caption read. “I had an emergency appendectomy last week and while it’s been quite a painful experience, I also know it’s a gift to even feel this pain. I realize after speaking with my doctor that it could have been much worse.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/carrie-ann-inaba-exits-the-talk-announces-leave-of-absence03.jpg><p><span>In the video, Carrie Ann sat in her hospital bed after undergoing surgery and provided some updates on her diagnosis. She revealed her recovery time is four to six weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Appendicitis attacks happen suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere,” the former host of </span><i><span>The Talk</span></i><span> continued. “And when you are in that much pain, the last thing you want to do is go anywhere. And when you have autoimmune disease, you are often having strange health occurrences that no one can explain or help you with so sometimes, you try to wait it out like I did. I was wrong.”</span></p><p><span>Carrie Ann revealed that her symptoms first began when she felt intense pain in her abdomen followed by “violent vomiting” that left her unable to stand. Eventually, the pain was so unbearable that it sent her to the hospital and led her to receive her appendicitis diagnosis.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>What Chronic Illnesses Does Carrie Ann Inaba Have?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Carrie Ann also suffers from several chronic health conditions that have led her to take time off from TV over the years. She is currently battling Sjogren’s syndrome, lupus, fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sjogren’s syndrome is “a disorder of your immune system identified by its two most common symptoms — dry eyes and a dry mouth,” per Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Hawaii-born dancer previously opened up about how she was managing the symptoms of her illnesses, including inflammation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“All I did was make sure that I was eating foods that loved me — that I loved and loved me back — [and] that I was doing my hyperbaric oxygen chamber,” she told </span><a href=#><span>Health Digest</span></a><span> in October 2022. “I was also making sure that every day, no matter how much pain I was in, that I did some sort of physical movement. That’s difficult. That sounds so simple for most people, but when you’re having an active flare-up, and your body won’t respond to you the way you want it to, it’s almost impossible.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKuqmZp6orrNZqCnmZKWeqmxwKWroWWjqr%2BosdGyZKudk6TDpr7YZqypnJGpsrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gift-ideas-for-anyone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gift Ideas to Give Anyone and Everyone on Your List</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-sex-lives-of-college-girls-season-3-everything-to-know.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Sex Lives of College Girls Season 3: Everything to Know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
