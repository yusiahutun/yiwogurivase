While Taylor's <a class=hm-link href=#>initial set list</a> featured her song "invisible string" from the album folklore – <strong>a song about hopeful love and lovers being meant to be</strong> – she is now instead singing "the 1" from the same album, <strong>a song about past love.</strong></p><p id=eDai3WVJd_R data-wc=17><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift Eras tour: All the incredible fan outfits from Lover to Midnights and Speak Now</a></strong></p><p id=ePzR-gviO0 data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift dazzles in sequin co-ord at the Grammys and we're obsessed</a></strong></p><p id=eBfbdB4HMS9 data-wc=51>Some of the lyrics on "invisible string" go: "Isn't it just so pretty to think, all along there was some, invisible string, tying you to me?" Plus, the line, "One single thread of gold tied me to you," even led many to believe <strong>that the two were secretly engaged or married.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/321e9eb192f2-gettyimages-1173889599.jpg><p id=egwitmXHYEd data-wc=48>On the other hand, the lyrics of "the 1" painfully go: "But we were something, don't you think so? Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool, and if my wishes came true, it would've been you," and: <strong>"But it would've been fun, if you would've been the one."</strong></p><p id=eWFZIysg7Zc data-wc=62>Nonetheless, for those holding out hope that the two are still together, fans have found comfort in knowing that Taylor has still performed many of her other songs believed to be about Joe during her tour, including "Lover," "Lavender Haze," "Delicate," and "Mastermind." Other songs believed to be about him are "London Boy," Gorgeous," "King of My Heart," "Sweet Nothing," and more.</p><p id=euFAEseEL8q data-wc=6><strong>Read more&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
