As you may be aware, self-tanners are designed to darken the skin, mimicking the effects of sun exposure, through the use of active ingredients like dihydroxyacetone (DHA).&nbsp;</p><p>As per our expertise, a good self-tanner should provide an even, natural-looking tan without streaks or an orange hue. However, differentiating between quality self-tanners and ineffective ones can be a challenging task, especially when presented with a plethora of options. Safe to say, picking the best often comes down to formulation, application method, and user reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>We recommend looking for products with moisturizing ingredients like glycerin or hyaluronic acid to prevent dryness and ensure an even application. Additionally, opt for self-tanners that offer a buildable tan to customize the depth of color. Common ingredients found in self-tanners include DHA, erythrulose, and various botanical extracts.&nbsp;</p><p>With the right product and application technique, drugstore self-tanners can provide a safe and healthy glow year-round. Here we have rounded up the top self-tanners available in drugstores. So read on and take your pick.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>9 Best Drugstore Self-tanners</h2></p><p>Achieve your deepest tan yet with B.tan Darkest Possible self-tanner.
