Explaining how the Magic Mike actor was a perfect fit for the job, Mandel said, “He loves adventure. He loves gamesmanship, and I think he's handling the position wonderfully and I am so excited about being a small part of that show.”</p><h2 id=6628ffc2cb0f6><strong>What Did Howie Mandel Say About The Show Deal or No Deal Island?</strong></h2><p>With a whopping $200 million cash prize, the highest since the premiere of the franchise in 2005, the latest spin-off series is "dangerous, exciting, and bigger than anything, even from the original," the Canadian comedian and actor said.</p><p>“People can be bitten by snakes. They can drown in the mud, they're in the jungle. It's epic. It checks every box of everything that people want to see," he said while jokingly adding that Manganiello is “almost as handsome as me.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><br><h2 id=6628ffc2cb104><strong>What Is The Show Deal or No Deal Island About?</strong></h2><p>Deal or No Deal Island is a “spin on the classic game” in which the contestants are sent to the mysterious Banker’s secret island to engage in a completely immersive, season-long competition for the cash at stake.</p><p>Premiered on February 26 on NBC, the spin-off reality game show features 13 contestants including former Deal or No Deal model Claudia Jordan and former Survivor contestant "Boston" Rob Mariano.</p><h2 id=6628ffc2cb109><strong>NBC Announced Joe Manganiello As New Host of Deal or No Deal Island</strong></h2><p>In September last year, NBC released a statement announcing <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","‘He&#39;s Amazing&#39;: Howie Mandel Praises Joe Manganiello&#39;s Hosting Skills On Deal Or No Deal Island","1298460","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-joe-manganiello-go-instagram-official-with-girlfriend-caitlin-after-latest-split-from-sofia-vergara-1280004","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/hes-amazing-howie-mandel-praises-joe-manganiellos-hosting-skills-on-deal-or-no-deal-island-1298460","Manganiello","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>Manganiello</a> as the new host of the spin-off show. “The role of Deal or No Deal host has always been held by someone charming, hilarious and devastatingly handsome,” said Corie Henson, Executive Vice President, of Unscripted Content, NBC Universal Entertainment. “When we took the show out of the studio and transported the game to the Banker’s island, Joe was the obvious choice. He loves all kinds of games, lives for adventure and isn’t afraid to stare down a snake or two to help players win a life-changing payday and, hopefully, beat the Banker at his own game.”&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the opportunity, Manganiello told People earlier that he is a big fan of game shows and that Mandel and Survivor host Jeff Probst have been his inspiration. “I was waiting for the right opportunity to happen and this was it. I was asked to be on Survivor at one point. I was offered Fear Factor — not the original, but after (Joe)&nbsp;Rogan stepped aside, I was offered the next incarnation. So they pitched me the show, (Deal or No Deal Island). I was like, you have no idea who you're talking to. I'm a big fan of game shows. One of the huge draws is to see how people interact with each other.”</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2BdsrR5wKaYs6GenHqpu9ainGalkaOxpriMqamaoaOawG62zp5kppmenK6vtcSlo6irXZ28tMDIp55mq5ueua2%2FjKilZpyVlrluu9FmpahllJqurXnIrKOappRifnOFl21taQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jaafar-jackson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jaafar Jackson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zodiac-signs-extrovert.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Which Signs Are The Most Outgoing?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
