Where is she today?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f0d1d20a9ea41608.jpg><p class=align-left>The Grammy winner songs depicted his poor relationship with his mother, which, to be fair, was extremely brutal. Many people wonder whether the rapper's expression of his relationship with his mother is an accurate depiction.</p><p class=align-left>Regardless, he created a tainted image, which Debbie has been struggling to correct over time. Where is Debbie Mathers now?</p><h2>Who is Debbie Mathers?</h2><p class=align-left>Eminem's mother, Deborah R. Nelson – Mathers, was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> on January 6, 1955, in St. Joseph, Missouri, U.S.A. This means that she is 66 years old in 2021. Debbie's parents are Betty Hixson and Bob Nelson, and she grew up with four siblings named Steven, Todd, Betty Rene, and Ronnie Polkinghorn.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d5ad3bf23cc0ba8e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Christina Raines now: Latest updates of Drew Peterson's ex-girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Debbie experienced a lot of problems when she was young. For instance, her brother Ronnie committed suicide, and another sibling was incarcerated for killing his brother-in-law. Also, according to Debbie's account, she was abused by her stepfather. Although she joined high school at the right time, she never completed her studies.</p><p class=align-left>Deborah married Marshall Bruce Mathers II at a tender age, probably an escape from her problems. According to various sources, Debbie was only 15 years old when she married Bruce. They welcomed their first and only son called Marshall Bruce Mathers III (Eminem), on October 17, 1972. It was a difficult birth as Debbie went into labour for 73-hours.</p><p class=align-left>Eminem's father, Bruce, left home when he was only 18 months old, which was one of the saddest and most challenging moments in Deborah's life. She later got involved with other people and became entangled in drugs.</p><p class=align-left>Debbie Mathers had to work demanding jobs to take care of her child, <a href=#>Eminem</a>. In most cases, she moved back and forth from Kansas City to Detroit, living in deplorable conditions. Debbie regularly faked her children's health to get money from organizations and people. Eminem has once stated that his mother never worked and relied on aid from social groups.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f89db765034c75ab.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where is Carol Ege now?

In some of them, Eminem recalled instances that he wished his mother was dead.</p><h2>Where is Eminem’s mother today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d5ad3bf23cc0ba8e.jpg><p class=align-left>Things have been quiet after Debbie and Eminem's court battle. After Debbie was diagnosed with breast cancer, matters between the two have calmed down further.</p><p class=align-left>The famous rapper released a song called <i>Headlights</i>, whereby he sings about his relationship with his mother in a positive light. Debbie Mathers is currently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> to John Briggs and has three grandchildren.</p><p class=align-left>In 2010, numerous sources reported that Eminem's mother was dead. However, they were talking about Edna Swartz, who immensely helped Eminem in his early life. He often refers to her as his real mother.</p><h2>Is that really Eminem's Mom in Headlights?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c7bcf83d293f0f75.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Seth Wrinkles story: what happened to Eric Wrinkles son?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When the <i>Headlights</i> song came out, many people wondered whether the woman in the video is Debbie Mathers, Eminem's mother. The video, directed by Spike Lee, shows Eminem’s story, from his mother’s point of view, depicting her loneliness. An actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">portrays</a> Eminem’s mother.</p><h2>Family reunion in court</h2><p class=align-left>In 1999, Debbie Mathers sued his son, demanding $10 million for slandering her name in his songs. Also, she accused Eminem of falsely accusing her of abusing illegal substances. So, did Eminem give his mom money?</p><p class=align-left>Eminem's lawyer during the case, Paul Rosenberg, responded by stating the following:</p>Eminem's life is reflected in his music. Everything he has said can be verified as true. Truth is an absolute defence to a claim of defamation. This lawsuit does not come as a surprise to Eminem. His mother has been threatening to sue him since the success of his single <i>My Name Is... </i>It is merely the result of a lifelong strained relationship between him and his mother. Regardless, it is still painful to be sued by your mother, and therefore the lawsuit will only be dealt with through legal channels.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0348febfb85ca7fa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth murders: What really happened?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The lawsuit was not successful, and Debbie only received $25,000 from the case's settlement. $23,354.25 went to his lawyer, leaving her with a meagre amount.</p><h2>Debbie Mathers relationship with Eminem</h2><p class=align-left>Eminem's lyrics give a clear indication that he did not have a good relationship with his mother. However, in the 2014 song, <i>Cleaning Out My Closet</i>, the rapper apologizes to her. He expressed that they are growing closer to one another.</p><p class=align-left>Deborah’s lawsuit in 1999 and claim that Eminem's managers wrote his songs created problems in their relationship. Although such strained the already-tattered connection, the two are seemingly mending things and forgetting about the past.</p><h2>Does Eminem talk to his mother?</h2><p class=align-left>Although Debbie and Eminem were estranged for a long time, the rapper, in an interview in 2016, stated that he still <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">loves his mother</a>. There is probably some tension between Eminem and his mother and awkwardness. It is not clear whether they are on talking terms, but they love and respect one another, and things are not as before.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie Holmes: Tom Cruise divorce story, dating, children, wedding</span></p></a><h2>Debbie’s book</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f89db765034c75ab.png><p class=align-left>Debbie Mathers penned a book titled <i>My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem</i>, released in 2008.

The book mainly talks about her relationship with her son, Eminem.</p><h2>How much is Debbie Mathers worth?</h2><p class=align-left>Eminem's mother has accumulated sizeable wealth, mostly because of his son's popularity. She has an estimated net worth of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$700,000</a>, a fraction of her son's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$230 million</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Since Debbie Mathers was often mentioned in Eminem's songs, it is hard separating the two.
