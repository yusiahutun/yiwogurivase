She is best known as the ex-wife of Canadian reality show star Jonathan Scott. Ulley and Scott were married for about two years in the mid-2000s before they went their separate ways. Many years after their divorce, Scott’s fans have been curious about his relationship with Ullie.</p><p>Well, Jonathan Scott, a television star and well-known celebrity, often appears on television and on screen. However, Kelsey Ully has kept her identity out of the media for a long time. In fact, she has hardly appeared in public since her divorce from Scott. So where is Kelsey Ully now? Has she moved on? Who is her boyfriend now? There are many questions to be answered about Ully.</p><p>So here we have prepared a detailed article about Ully, in which we will describe both her personal and professional life. Read the article.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kelsy Ully was Married Briefly to actor Jonathan Scott</strong></h2><p>Many people who have been following Jonathan Scott and his twin brother Drew Scott for a long time may not know that Jonathan was once married to a Canadian girl called Kelsey Ully. Well, Ully and John only stayed married for a couple of years, and even during that time they did not appear in public very often. That’s why Kelsey and Scott’s relationship is not talked about that often.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>People magazine</a>, Kelsey met her future husband Scott in early 2007. The couple soon hit it off and started dating within a few weeks. The magazine also mentioned that Scott flew from his hometown in Canada to Las Vegas to be with Ullie.</p><p>Kelsey Ully and Scott were married on 7 July 2007, after only months of an affair. Speaking about their whirlwind romance in March 2017, Scott told People magazine,</p><p>“We were young, and there was a rush going into it. She wanted to get married on 07/07/07 …so it wasn’t something that naturally happened.”</p><p>However, the lucky date did not work out in their married life. Scott added that he had learned a lot from his failed marriage to Kelsey Ulley. He added,</p><p>“I think that one of the biggest things I learned is that you can have two good people who are just not good for each other.”</p><p>Just three years into their married life, Kelsey and Scott found themselves in a situation from which they could go no further as husband and wife. They officially separated in 2010, but the divorce was finalised in 2013.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kelsy Ully Messy Divorce from Ex-Husband Jonathan Scott</strong></h2><p>Kelsey and Jonathan Scott were married for less than three years before they separated, and it took about four years to sort out the divorce. Before turning to their divorce, we want to make sure that the former couple’s divorce was not mutual. According to his memoir, It Takes Two: Our Story, Scott found out that his marriage had broken up on Facebook.</p><p>In fact, Scott saw that his then-wife Kelsey had deleted all the photos of him. She had also changed her marital status from married to empty. Jonathan stated that he was devastated after the break-up of his marriage. “For one too long, too bleak period of my life, that was practically all I did. It shook me to the core.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>In Touch</a>, Kelsey and Scott’s divorce took so long because of a legal document drawn up by Scott’s mother, which Ully says she signed “under duress and harassment”. The publication also mentioned that the court document was found to relate to the sale of the couple’s home in Canada.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>She Doesn’t Have Any Child From Her Marriage</strong></h2><p>Kelsey Ully has been living a secret life since her divorce from Jonathan Scott in 2013. Although legally married for more than five years, the ex-husband and wife lived together for only a few years. She and her ex-husband have no children together. Kelsey has not spent much happy time with Scott, so it can be said that the couple never planned to expand their family.</p><p>Furthermore, Kelsey’s relationships, apart from the one with Scott, have not been widely documented in the media. Therefore, for the time being, we can say that Kelsey has not yet experienced motherhood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kelsy Ully Ex-Husband is in a Happy Relationship</strong></h2><p>Although Kelsey’s relationship after her divorce from her ex-husband has not been disclosed, her ex-husband is still in a relationship. Scott has already been in several relationships. Scott started dating Jacinta Kuznetsova in 2016. They dated secretly for about a year before their affair attracted media attention.</p><p>At the time she started dating Scott, Jacinta was working as a radio producer, but she later started working as a development producer at Scott Entertainment. After a relationship lasting about two years, Scott and Jacinta separated for undisclosed reasons.</p><p>Since 2019, Scott has been dating Zooey Deschanel. In an interview with Hollywood Life, Scott revealed that he met Zooey during the Carpool Karaoke segment in August 2019. The couple quickly hit it off and started dating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Her Professional Career</strong></h2><p>Kelsy Ully’s professional career has included working as Director of Business Operations at Impel Systems. In her LinkedIn biography, she writes: “My role as Director of Business Operations is to develop strategic plans and roadmaps for operations and strategy.”</p><p>Prior to that, she worked as a Business Development Representative at Cascade Process Controls from April 2015 to May 2016. Also, from July 2014 to April 2015, she worked at Critical Control Energy Services Inc. From 2010 to 2014, Kelsey Ully worked at Auto Hail Pros as an Executive Assistant to the CEO as well as Office Manager. At the same time, from 2011 to 2013, she worked for Too Zero as a business consultant/software developer.</p><p>In addition, from November 2005 to August 2010, Ullie was Executive Assistant to the Secretary at Scott Real Estate. From May 2005 to December 2008, she was a Crew Planner at WestJet.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>The Truth About Francine Valli Death: Her Parents, Career, & More</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is Kelsy Ully Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Kelsy Ully has worked for more than a decade and a half, during which time she has certainly accumulated a good amount of money.

In the meantime, knowing what she has done over the years, we can say that she has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars.
