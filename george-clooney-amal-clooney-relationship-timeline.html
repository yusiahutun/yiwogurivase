And we just talked, we stayed up all night talking… And I got her email address, because she was going to send me some pictures of my parents. So we started writing. I didn't know if she wanted to go out with me — I just thought we were buddies."</p><p id=egZKUf3ClvF data-wc=18><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>George Clooney reveals how he first met wife Amal – and it leaves Drew Barrymore in shock</a></strong></p><p id=eM8TezchR5t data-wc=16><strong>DISCOVER: <a class=hm-link href=#>Amal Clooney dazzles in gold dress – and George can't take his eyes off her</a></strong></p><p id=eaRgovJNs78 data-wc=51>Amal evidently made a lasting impression on the star.

Following their <a class=hm-link href=#>fairytale nuptials</a>, the 45-year-old told Vogue: "I was 35 when I met him… It wasn't obvious that it was going to happen for me. And I wasn't willing or excited about the idea of getting married or having a family in the absence of that."</p><h2><strong>When did George Clooney propose to Amal?</strong></h2><p id=eOCZeHu69rd data-wc=31>George decided to pop the question after a romantic trip to Kenya. In an interview with Vogue, the Golden Globe Award-winning actor opened up about a key moment in his life.</p><p id=eaqgFj9uwKd data-wc=59>On the subject of their safari getaway, he revealed: "<strong>Some giraffes walked up to her.

"I plotted the whole thing out. I had the ring hidden behind her. I had music playing, my Aunt Rosemary's gonna sing 'Why Shouldn't I?' on a playlist. Everything was planned out," George explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d51c0c9e1aa-gettyimages-473029800.jpg><p id=e9iaYvfnGpo data-wc=56>After a romantic dinner, George strategically blew out a dinner candle, prompting Amal to fetch a nearby lighter.

"It had never been part of my DNA," the actor told The Hollywood Reporter. "<strong>We didn't plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p id=ex_HpC0ZZnO data-wc=44>"There was an assumption that we didn't want them.
