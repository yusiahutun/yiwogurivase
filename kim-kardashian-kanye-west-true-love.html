The Yeezus rapper, who prefers to keep his private life out of the limelight, has said he makes appearances on his girlfriend's family's hit reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians out of love for Kim. "Oh, that's just all for love," said Kanye, speaking to W. "It's simply that. At a certain point, or always, love is more important than any branding, or any set of cool people, or attempting to impress anyone. Because true love is just the way you feel."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3cf8499468ec-kim-kanye-2-z.jpg><p id=elvWf08KhTIm data-wc=103>While Kanye dotes on his girlfriend, the rapper is said to be on less good terms with Kim's mother and manager, <a class=hm-link href=#>Kris Jenner</a>, as revealed in an anecdote by W. During the interview, the singer played a clip of his unfinished song Awesome to Kris, which is said to be about his girlfriend and makes a slight jibe at her mother. The lyrics included the lines, "Cause baby, you're awesome, you don't need to listen to your manager, you're way too hot for them to handle you." After listening to the song, Kris responded with "Great job!" which the rapper did not take well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6c1b3f811cf2-kanye-kris-z.jpg><p id=eHeYSOi9jNqK data-wc=127>"Great job, Baccarat, for making a glass that can hold liquid!" he said, toasting his champagne glass. "Great job, belt loops, for keeping my pants up!" he said, looking down at his belt. Kris laughed off the mockery, hugging Kanye and saying, "I love you. You know where to find us. Call us tomorrow, if you want." It seems Kanye is showering all his love and affection on Kim and their baby daughter, <a class=hm-link href=#>North West, who was born earlier this month.</a> He is said <a class=hm-link href=#>to be "in love" with the baby</a>, and didn't leave the maternity room for the first few days after her birth. The couple have since moved to a private property which remains undisclosed to the public. "He's, like, in love with the baby," said reality TV star Larsa Pippen, a close friend of Kim. "It's so cute."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/81d368ae4e48-kim-kanye-1-z.jpg><p id=ejhooE005OCG data-wc=105>Both Kim and Kanye have been keeping a low profile since the premature birth of their daughter, but <a class=hm-link href=#>Kanye is expected to attend True Magazine's birthday party</a> on 27 June, his first public appearance since becoming a father. It is thought that the singer will join friend and fellow dad Jay-Z at the party in Los Angeles to celebrate the hip hop publication's 14th year anniversary. <a class=hm-link href=#>Beyoncé</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Jay-Z</a> are close friends of the couple, and the female superstar earlier congratulated the new parents on their baby. "Congratulations Kim & Kanye. Enjoy this beautiful moment together," she posted on her website, alongside a picture of the couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbGdvamVmgHKFlWiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK4orrYnmSwnaOperW%2B1J5kpaemmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./katherine-heigl-reveals-bold-new-hairstyle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Katherine Heigl reveals bold new hairstyle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./theresa-golden-bachelor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Theresa End Up With Gerry on The Golden Bachelor?
