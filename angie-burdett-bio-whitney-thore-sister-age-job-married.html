The show is back for season 11 and now fans will get to meet Angie.</p><p>But before that let us help you know where she is from, her age, her job, her husband, and her children. The answer unfolds as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Meet Angie Burdett, Whitney Thore Sister</strong></h3><p>Whitney Way Thore disclosed in the eleventh season of My Big Fat Fabulous Life that she has an undiscovered long-lost sister named Angie Burdett. In season 11 of My Big Fat Fabulous Life, Whitney returns to discuss her life path. It was recently discovered that Whitney has a long-lost sister named Angie whom she was unaware of.</p><p>The fitness app entrepreneur and reality star rose to fame after disclosing her weight loss techniques on YouTube. Whitney created dancing videos of herself, which caught people’s interest and eventually led to the possibility of her own reality program.</p><p>Whitney’s relationship with her family is shown in the episode of My Big Fat Fabulous Life. She always got along well with both of her parents, Barbara “Babs” and Glenn Thore. Hunter Thore, Whitney’s older brother, is four years Whitney’s senior. The Thore family experienced tragedy in 2022 when her mother Babs tragically passed away at the age of 76 following a stroke.</p><p>Whitney, Glenn, and Hunter have been mourning her loss and miss her terribly ever since her passing.</p><p>Whitney learned about her half-sister Angie, about whom not much is known when her mother suffered her second stroke. After his wife died, Whitney gave Glenn something to do, so he assisted her in moving into her new home. They engaged in joint activities like swimming laps.</p><p>However, Glenn’s revelation that she shared a child with Jackie, a woman he dated before meeting Babs, was unexpected.</p><p>Babs experienced her first stroke in 2017. According to Whitney, her mother was identified with cerebral amyloid angioplasty, an “untreatable progressive condition caused by proteins in the blood vessels of the brain that can cause dementia, seizures, or like in my mom’s case, brain bleeding (hemorrhagic strokes),” as HollywoodLife reported.</p><p>Babs suffered another stroke in December 2021, despite the doctors’ predictions to the Thore family that she would have more strokes in the future. Babs, the mother of Whitney, suffered her final stroke in November 2022, which finally caused her death, from a condition called cerebral amyloid angiopathy.</p><p>Glenn previously knew about Angie, but he didn’t actually meet her until after Babs had passed away. Hunter, Whitney’s brother, advised that Glenn create a bucket list to help him deal with Babs’ passing on My Big Fat Fabulous Life. Glenn has a bucket list that includes visiting Switzerland and getting a tattoo.</p><p>Viewers will witness Glenn call Angie later in the season and arrange a meeting with her, along with Whitney and Hunter. It will be touching to see the family members reunite in My Big Fat Fabulous Life season 11 when they first meet.</p><h3><strong>Angie Burdett Age</strong></h3><p>Angie Burdett turned 55 in 2023. She was born in 1968.</p><h3><strong>Angie Burdett Job</strong></h3><p>Angie Burdett reportedly worked as a Bartender at Oysters Rockefeller.

Her husband is named Shanon Burdett. On Angie’s birthday in 2018, Shanon wished his wife, “Happy birthday to My ANGIE.

My dad has been in the hospital for 15 days now we are at Rehab for at least another 2 weeks and he has done anything and everything to help I couldn’t do this without you Love You (My Angie).”</p><p>Likewise, on Father’s Day June 2023, Angela again wished her husband, “Happy Father’s Day to my Husband!
