The couple <a class=hm-link href=#>split up</a> once before in 2019, but remained close.&nbsp;</p><p id=efeqslM7G4D data-wc=37>Talking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Harper's Bazaar</a> in March 2020, Kylie explained how she looked to her parents Kris and Caitlyn Jenner's parenting example for inspiration with how she and Travis should take care of Stormi, despite their split.</p><p id=e1kA8eZwwhH data-wc=19>"[Travis and I] both love Stormi and want what’s best for her", she began. "We stay connected and coordinated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28138163f522-kylie-jenner-travis-scott-relationship-timeline-stormi-z.jpg><p id=e6cThyJOSEy data-wc=26>"I think about [my parents], in situations with Stormi, what they would do. They were very hands-on with me, and I want the same for Stormi".</p><p id=e-S6c1KJpbZ data-wc=43>Following this principle, during the Covid-19 pandemic the romantically estranged couple chose to quarantine together so that they could both be with their daughter Stormi. And in a delightful twist for fans of the pair, lockdown led to the two relighting their spark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/34e0084d10ea-kylie-travis-stormi-2021.jpg><p id=eBygNROBPXP data-wc=50>In 2021, Travis and Kylie began to appear at events as a couple again, confirming reports that they had got back together. The couple then delighted fans by documenting their many glamourous dates and days out with each other on social media, such as when they <a class=hm-link href=#>visited London last August</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQmZDZGwig- data-wc=59>However, since December 2022, Travis and Kylie have not been seen out together, leading to the assumption that the two have gone their separate ways once more. With that being said, the rapper did comment "A beauty" on one of the makeup mogul's Instagram posts in April 2023, so a second reconciliation between the two shouldn't be ruled out.</p><h2>When did Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott meet?</h2><p id=erjj0yHyINot data-wc=47>Kylie and Travis met in April 2017 at Coachella. Perhaps surprisingly for an otherwise <a class=hm-link href=#>very public facing family</a> such as Kylie's, information exploring just how the two first met at the event and what led to them deciding to start dating was for a while very scarce.</p><p id=eX1KegSqFMoe data-wc=19>However, during a 2018 joint interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>GQ</a> the two stars finally opened up about how their relationship began.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4acecddfda60-kylie-jenner-travis-scott-relationship-timeline-sister-z.jpg><p id=eYb7-XmxPS2a style=text-align:center data-wc=8><strong>Kylie with her sister Kendall in January 2017</strong></p><p id=e3_2IDuNwpRm data-wc=34>"Coachella was one of the stops on his tour,” Kylie told the magazine. "So he said, 'I'm going back on tour—what do we want to do about this?' Because we obviously liked each other."</p><p id=e_gDY75Xuh8u data-wc=12>She continued: "And I was like, "I guess I'm going with you'"</p><p id=eUnjC64NzQvr data-wc=37>Following this uber-romantic sounding hook-up, the couple were spotted besotted with each other at various events and on their social media. The singer and businesswoman later revealed on Snapchat that they'd got matching tattoos in June 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/926949642dfc-kylie-jenner-travis-scott-relationship-timeline-date-z.jpg><p id=ePJJnba2PvXp style=text-align:center data-wc=10><strong>The couple were noticed hanging out a lot in 2017</strong></p><p id=e7JCBk_02eiZ data-wc=16>Less than a year later, the pair became parents for the first time in <a class=hm-link href=#>February 2018</a>.</p><h2>What happened between Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott?</h2><p id=eqow5IIR2jM data-wc=39>Kylie and Travis were together for around five years. We don't know what led to their rumored recent split, but it is known that their relationship faced <a class=hm-link href=#>many hard times</a> as well as high points in that half decade.</p><p id=eSLS6GSORtV data-wc=47>In particular, Travis faced public scrutiny in recent years following the deaths of ten people in a crowd crush at Astroworld Festival, the music festival he founded, in November 2021. The <a class=hm-link href=#>tragic incident</a> led to a police investigation and to numerous lawsuits being filed against the event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/885eb5f65a24-kylie-jenner-travis-scott-relationship-timeline-travis-singing-z.jpg><p id=eQgXdG269t8G style=text-align:center data-wc=8><strong data-gid=ewPFs753vB-X>Travis performing at a separate event in 2022</strong></p><p id=eAhvAvx7ohA8 data-wc=32>Shortly after the festival, Kylie, who had been at the show with her and Travis' then three-year-old daughter Stormi, took to Instagram to share <a class=hm-link href=#>her and her partner's heartache</a> at the situation.</p><p id=eigAnE_MO4gW data-wc=45>"Travis and I are broken and devastated," she began. "My thoughts and prayers are with all who lost their lives, were injured or affected in anyway by yesterday's events.
