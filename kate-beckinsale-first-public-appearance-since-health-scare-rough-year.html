In addition to struggling with her own health, the Underworld star's stepfather Roy Battersby passed away from a massive stroke while battling two forms of cancer in January, and her mother Judy Loe has been battling stage four cancer.</p><p>"It's been a rough year," she said. "Because my parents have both been unwell and my cat ... it's been a bunch of things. So that's why it's nice to come and see friends and have a little perspective. Everyone's had a bit of a rough year, I think."</p><p>Meanwhile, the British star -- who rocked a stunning one-shouldered white gown and platform heels at the event -- <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>praised </strong></a><a href=#><strong>King Charles III </strong></a>for being "open" about his cancer diagnosis, saying that she's "impressed" by the monarch. King Charles <a href=#><strong>revealed his diagnosis </strong></a>in February. (His daughter-in-law <a href=#><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a> <a href=#><strong>shared</strong></a> her cancer diagnosis in March.)</p><p>"My mum's got cancer and my stepdad just died of cancer, and I think having a monarchy that is... you know, people kinda go 'Why've you got it? What's it for?' And all of that," Beckinsale told PEOPLE. "Then there's this, and actually being really open about quite personal things that I think is really important."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I'm really impressed that he's doing that," she added.</p><p>The 50-year-old also revealed that her mom "happened to be at the same cancer hospital" as King Charles during a recent checkup.</p><p>"I hope everyone gets better. I'm f--king sick of cancer, I really am," Beckinsale said.</p><p>The Pearl Harbor actress also opened up to PEOPLE about why it's "important" for her to get involved with King's Trust, a health and social care charity in England.</p><p>"First of all, usually when [King’s Trust Global Ambassador] Edward [Enninful] tells me to do something, I do it," Beckinsale joked, before adding, "Second of all, I've been to this event a few times and you come in and you see all the people that you're friends with that you haven't seen for a while and that's really nice," she continued. "And then it gets like to that moment where the kids start talking and you're like, this is why we're all here. It's so moving and inspiring."</p><p>"And you really realize how much of an amazing job the King's Trust does with these kids. Their whole futures are completely altered by this charity," she shared. "It's so important."</p><p>Beckinsale's appearance at the event comes nearly two months after she first sparked concern among fans when she shared photos from a hospital bed.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:95563f4b-8a26-4809-95ef-beb3fa92db9b data-container-ref=toofab:article:e39b2698-22c2-41c0-96e6-e42192e094cc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fd/5by4/2024/03/11/fd0a60fd2e174412a6dcc27afccd8dd8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kate Beckinsale Worries Fans after Sharing Pictures from Hospital Bed</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In a since-deleted Instagram post, Beckinsale honored her mom on her birthday and for UK Mother's Day, sharing seemingly teary-eyed photos of herself in a hospital bed. She did not reveal details regarding her hospital day.</p><p>In her caption, Beckinsale wrote, "Happy birthday and UK Mother’s Day this last week to my incredible mother. Thank you to those that love us and support us when it’s s--t and try to make sure there are some bits that aren't. And for looking after our dogs when we can't, and lead us to remember happy things when we can't. And turn up when we are sick and sit with us ... And send balloons and check in and pull us out of wells with love."</p><p>"Thank you for loving us, those who do, and for the amazing, kindest Nick, and especially for my mother’s capacity for joy," she continued.
