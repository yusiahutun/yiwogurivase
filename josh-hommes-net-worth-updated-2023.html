This internationally famous group has made Gene and his fellow band members enormously wealthy.</p><p>However, Simmons’ wealth didn’t come from the actual music itself, although it helped, of course.</p><p>Through licensing agreements on merchandise, Gene and the band placed their logo and iconic name on more than 5,000 different products, from t-shirts to pinball machines.</p><p>As of September 2023, Gene Simmons’s net worth is estimated to be $400 Million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gene-simmons-facts></span>Gene Simmons Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Gene Simmons is his stage name, but his actual birth name is Chaim Witz.</li><li>Even with his rockstar persona, Gene doesn’t drink or do drugs, as his mother wouldn’t like it.</li><li>Gene’s hair caught on fire at the band’s first concert in 1973, when he performed a fire-breathing stunt.</li><li>He created a <a href=#>TV series</a> called Gene Simmons’ Family Jewels, which gave the viewers an inside look into the rock star’s life.</li><li>One of KISS’s biggest hits, “I Was Made for Lovin’ You” is one of Gene’s least favorite songs to play, as he believes his voice sounds like his grandmother when he sings it.</li><li>Gene is multilingual, being fluent in German, Hebrew, Japanese, Hungarian, and English.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chaim Witz was <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Simmons data-lasso-id=103935 data-wpel-link=external data-cke-saved->born August 25, 1949</a>, in Haifa, Israel.</p><p>His family are Holocaust survivors, with his mother, brother, and uncle the only family members to survive a Nazi concentration camp.</p><p>Gene and his mother left Israel when Gene was 8 and the two moved to Queens, New York City.</p><p>After moving to America, Gene took on a more <a href=#>American</a>-sounding name, calling himself Eugene Klein.</p><p>His mother saw that he was passionate about music and bought him his first guitar, but after a while, Gene decided to change over to the base, which he believed would help him get into a band more easily.</p><p>While at high school, he put together his first band called Lynx, which was shortly after renamed, Missing Links.</p><p>Gene moved on to a new band called The Long Island Sounds while attending Sullivan County Community College. He then transferred to Richmond College, where he earned a degree in <a href=#>education</a> and started teaching grade school Spanish.</p><p>To supplement his teaching work, he became an assistant to the editor of the Vogue and Glamour magazines.</p><p>While working alongside the glamorous editor, he decided to change his name to Gene Simmons, which would go on to be one of the most famous names in rock music worldwide.</p><p>Shortly after that, he joined a band called Bullfrog Beer, taking his first major step in his music career that would eventually lead him to meet Paul Stanley.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Once Gene met Paul, they decided to team up and form a band called Wicked Lester, which was immediately successful as they signed a deal with Epic Records.</p><p>The band’s first album was a disaster, so Paul and Gene set out to become one of the best bands in the world.</p><p>They teamed up with Peter Crisis, a drummer, along with guitarist Paul Frehley, marking the start of the legendary band, KISS.</p><p>Their manager suggested that they wear full-stage makeup as a way to stand out from other bands and the fans loved it.</p><p>They released their first album in 1974, which was popular, but the next two albums were a bust. To build momentum, the band decided to perform live, and with Gene’s fire-breathing stunt, built their reputation for performing amazing live shows.</p><p>They recorded their first show and the album went on to reach quadruple platinum status. The band played for 5 years and was incredibly successful, but they ultimately decided to pursue their solo careers.</p><p>After pursuing their solo careers, the band decided to get back together but was met with backlash from their fans. The makeup and Genes theatrics were not impressing the crowds anymore, so they decided to play without makeup or any other unusual gimmicks.</p><p>This new look helped the band grow in popularity, but it wasn’t working for them, so Peter Criss was voted out of the band and replaced with Paul Charles (stage name Eric Carr), who played for KISS up until he died in 1991.</p><p>In 2013, Paul Stanley and Gene teamed up with Doc Mcghee to become part owners of the LA Kiss Arena Football League team.</p><p>With the band’s decline, Gene released some solos, which you can see more of on his <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://www.instagram.com/genesimmons data-lasso-id=103937 data-wpel-link=external data-cke-saved->official Instagram account</a>, and focuses on his publication, the Gene Simmons Tongue Magazine.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gene-simmons%e2%80%99s-career-earnings></span>Gene Simmons’s Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gene earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from his stage performances and album sales, but the real money was in licensing deals he helped negotiate.</p><p>It is believed that Gene Simmons now earns a salary of over $34 million annually.</p><p>Here’s an estimated overview of Gene Simmons’s annual income:</p><ul><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2013 – $25 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2014 – $26.4 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2015 – $25 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2016 – $28 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2017 – $29 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2018 – $29.5 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2019 – $28 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2020 – $30 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2021 – $32.5 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Salary In 2022 – $34 million</li></ul><p>With sales of KISS merchandise still ticking along, Gene and his fellow band members continue to enjoy the financial rewards of their iconic status.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gene-simmon%e2%80%99s-net-worth-annually></span>Gene Simmon’s Net Worth Annually<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite the rockstar persona and garish makeup, Gene is a down-to-earth individual with a head for numbers and an excellent grasp of investment strategy.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of Gene Simmons’s annual net worth:</p><ul><li>Gene Simmons’s Net Worth In 2017 – $260 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Net Worth In 2018 – $280 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Net Worth In 2019 – $320 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Net Worth In 2020 – $350 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Net Worth In 2021 – $375 million</li><li>Gene Simmons’s Net Worth In 2022 – $400 million</li></ul><p>&nbsp;By investing the money he received from the band’s live performances and commercial deals, Gene has amassed enormous wealth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gene is currently married to Canadian <a href=#>actress</a>, Shannon Lee Tweed.
