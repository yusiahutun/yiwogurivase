css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Marco Leung Ka-hin broke his nose in Brisbane in July and as a result needed two separate operations costing more than HK$51,000, but months later the guard had still not been able to recoup the money, leaving him “helpless and worried”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung said the association had told him to “seek medical help first and come back with invoices”, but officials had not said which doctor he should visit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/20/af5ffc7d-637b-4722-b9c1-46ad885b7ade_e18049fa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve asked the person in charge [at HKBA] four times from August to November [for an update] but all I was told was that it is an ongoing procedure, without further details,” the 23-year-old said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Basketball bosses have admitted to buying medical insurance which caps any individual claim by a player at HK$10,000, and have even advised players to make further claims through their own policies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Norman Chan Sui-tim, the association’s chairman, said the governing body had “purchased travel and medical insurance” for overseas trips, and the policies were bought “on the professional advice of the insurance company”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That company, Dah Sing Insurance, said it provided coverage “addressing customer’s needs based on their professional judgment and past experience on the injury risks for different events and activities, their affordability and the agent’s recommendation”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dah Sing also said it “had not received any request to adjust the coverage” since beginning to provide insurance to the association in 2015.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked whether players could feel safe representing the city while balancing the potential risk of needing to pay for injuries out of their own pocket, Chan urged them to “stay positive”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The association will seek professional advice from the insurance industry as well as seeking help from the funding departments, and hope the situation can be improved,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/20/f2f83a62-a561-420e-aa3e-f73119f56df2_358bf128.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, this was not the first time a player has failed to be fully reimbursed for a medical claim while on duty with the national team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another player suffered a facial fracture playing against Australia in 2020, and a severe concussion left him unable to fly back with the team because of the cabin pressure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The player had to stay overseas for three weeks, and he said the HKBA, “also took a very long time to only give me a partial reimbursement”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The senior team figure had another unfortunate injury, this time a broken nose, in February when playing for Hong Kong at the 2025 FIBA Asia Cup qualifiers in Mongolia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For the most recent incident, the total sum was around HK$70,000, the HKBA covered HK$10,000 and my own insurance gave HK$13,000,” he said. “They told me while we were still in Mongolia and I knew from the beginning [their insurance was not enough to cover the entire expense].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There has been no shortage of controversial issues concerning the HKBA in recent years. The association decided to abandon the Asia Cup pre-qualifiers in April 2022 without consulting any players, before reapplying for participation after their decision caught massive attention from the media and the government.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The decider between Fukien and Well Born was moved from Queen Elizabeth Stadium to Island East Sports Centre, which has no room for spectators, but a public backlash forced a U-turn just 24 hours later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mm5mjoLK1rsClo2iZoqm2pLjEaGprbGJmhHd7x6iloGWbpLuoecGaqqSdpJeurbiMqaOasZWnwG64xJ%2BrZqCVm8G6ecyem6KbkaF6o7XLpapmmZapsrN5wqKrsmWfm7Oqr8iao6xllpa2rXnBrrBmnZ6kwqi0jKKlrK2ilruksQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sydney-sweeney-dad-grandpa-walked-out-watching-euphoria-7507994.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sydney Sweeney Said Her Dad and Grandpa &amp;quot;Walked Out&amp;quot; the First Time They Watched 'Euphoria'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lara-trump-meeting-the-queen-and-shows-baby-bump-hello-exclusive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Exclusive: Lara Trump opens up about meeting the Queen as she shows off her beautiful baby bump</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
