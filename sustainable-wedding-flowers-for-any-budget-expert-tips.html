Larry explains: "We have recently partnered with a charitable confetti company that uses our flowers post-wedding, dries them and turns them into natural confetti. They then make a charitable donation for each sale. It is wonderful to see our flowers going to a good home after they have already been enjoyed."</p><p id=eWJH4qYjVNOFl data-wc=17><strong></strong></p><h2><strong>How much do wedding flowers cost on average?</strong></h2><p id=eN4DRl3PJA9oq data-wc=70><strong>*</strong> This <strong>varies hugely</strong> so our best suggestion if you would like to understand what you should be investing in, is to <strong>gather ideas of what you like, arrange consultations with reputable vendors</strong> and ask for their advice. Bloom is always happy to guide their clients and inform them of what budget should be allocated towards their wedding design in order to achieve the results they have been dreaming about.</p><p id=e-ExoKY8dbNQE data-wc=63>* Do consider that some choices which are more sustainable may cost a little more too. However, <strong>consumer demand typically drives down this price&nbsp;</strong>so until we can all start requesting it, it sits a little higher than usual. Support these suppliers, help bring attention to the products that matter and spend a little more to have a more sustainable and conscious celebration.</p><p id=ePBzMjRACKVMi data-wc=16><strong>SEE: <a aria-label="Wedding heatwave hacks! 7 expert tips to deal with hot weather on your big day" class=hm-link href=#>Wedding heatwave hacks! 7 expert tips to deal with hot weather on your big day</a></strong></p><p id=e0kyqD9eEsl_3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/affae72d72a5-larry-walshe-jermaine-defoe1-z.jpg></strong><p id=eJWnHA-E5OPT><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e_T7U5RZ0CugE style=text-align:center data-wc=4><strong>Florists are professional creatives</strong></p><h2><strong>How can brides make eco-friendly choices on a tight budget?</strong></h2><p id=eT8pwa6tR5htU data-wc=34><strong>*</strong> "<strong>Eco-friendly choices don’t necessarily need to cost more money</strong>.
