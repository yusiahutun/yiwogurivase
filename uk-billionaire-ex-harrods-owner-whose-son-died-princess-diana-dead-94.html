He built his family’s fortune in real estate, shipping and construction, first in the Middle East and then in Europe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Al-Fayed owned establishment symbols such as Harrods, Fulham and the Ritz hotel in Paris, he was always an outsider in Britain, tolerated but not embraced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He fell out with the British government over its refusal to grant him citizenship of the country that was his home for decades, and often threatened to move to France, which gave him the Legion of Honour, its highest civilian award.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Scotland Yard investigating claim SAS was behind Princess Diana's death</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Al-Fayed – who could be charming, autocratic, vindictive, and at times wildly outspoken – spent 10 years trying to prove Diana and his son Dodi were murdered when their car crashed in a road tunnel in Paris in 1997 as they tried to outrun paparazzi photographers on motorbikes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unsupported by any evidence, according to the inquest into Diana’s death, he claimed that she was bearing Dodi’s child and accused Prince Philip, the queen’s husband, of ordering Britain’s security services to kill her to stop her marrying a Muslim and having his baby.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Al-Fayed died on Wednesday, his family said, a day before the 26th anniversary of Dodi and Diana’s death.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Mrs Mohamed Al-Fayed, her children and grandchildren wish to confirm that her beloved husband, their father and their grandfather, Mohamed, has passed away peacefully of old age,” the family statement read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/02/d5f09502-269c-4025-8c0a-da58532f8cd3_9f2a84f8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Al-Fayed was known for self-invention, exaggeration, and boasting, he was also a central figure in key moments in Britain’s recent history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His rancorous takeover of Harrods in 1985 sparked one of Britain’s most bitter business feuds, while in 1994 he caused a scandal with the disclosure that he had paid politicians to ask questions on his behalf in parliament.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like many billionaires, Al-Fayed spurned convention. He once said he wanted to be mummified in a golden sarcophagus in a glass pyramid on the roof of Harrods.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the store, where he instituted a dress code – even for customers – which he enforced in person, he installed a kitsch bronze memorial statue of Diana and Dodi dancing beneath the wings of an albatross.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the owner of Fulham, he erected a larger-than-life, sequinned statue of Michael Jackson outside the ground even though the singer only attended one match. When people complained, he said: “If some stupid fans don’t understand or appreciate such a gift, they can go to hell.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/02/63dd472e-42e6-4453-bc39-3a697403ba74_bc7273d8.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/02/544171a0-f955-4c76-a794-3fa8a2715c8f_fe248171.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the summer of 1997, Al-Fayed’s son Dodi began a relationship with Princess Diana, who had divorced Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne. Dodi and Diana were pictured by British tabloids on holiday on a yacht in the south of France.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After travelling to Paris, the couple were killed when their Mercedes, driven at high speed by a chauffeur who had been drinking whisky and was trying to evade the paparazzi, crashed into a concrete pillar in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beset by grief and an overwhelming sense of injustice, Al-Fayed spent millions on legal battles to ensure there was an inquest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it started in London a decade after the crash, Al-Fayed would accuse everyone from the royal family, prime minister Tony Blair, Diana’s sister Sarah, the French embalmers of Diana’s body, and the Paris ambulance drivers of being implicated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the jury said the couple were unlawfully killed by their chauffeur’s driving. Al-Fayed said he accepted the verdict and gave up legal attempts to show they were murdered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m leaving the rest for God to get my revenge,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXymwdGop55nkafBqq%2FLnmZsamNof3KBjq6iZpqZobmqu82aoKudXZrFbrTAq6monKNivLi6xKtksKCfqLJuv86nZJ2hlZl6sb7Ip5qeq6NisaqtzZpknZ2RmXp6gA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./90s-boyband-are-unrecognizable-decades-later-but-new-photos-will-make-you-feel-old.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>90s boyband are unrecognizable decades later but new photos will make you feel old</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-quinn.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Quinn Wiki, Bio, Boyfriend, Height, Weight, Age &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
