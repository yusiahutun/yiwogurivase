Our contributor Kristin Speakman, an experienced hairstylist, salon owner and beauty industry coach, defines the bob as a classic cut and look! She says, “With the density of hair decreasing as we get older, the bold line of a bob gives a fuller look. Add a deep part and side swipe, the hair appears to be more and fuller around the face. There’s also something to be said about a bob just looking more polished and intentional. It’s a timeless cut that will never go away.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3 id=6579bdd473a68><strong>2.

But it's her stunning salt and pepper tresses that have been stealing the show and bringing her look to life. And the best part is, this edgy hairstyle can also serve as a trendy way to gradually embrace your own gray hair. Our contributor Kristin Speakman, recommends a crop or pixie cut for all women. She says, “It’s a bolder look, and for many women longer hair is their safety net and so, they never cut it short. I think there’s something to be said about women over 50 or 60 who become more unapologetic as they age, and have the most sense of self. Of course as our bodies age it changes too, and hair density can lessen, and texture can change. With hair less dense, a shorter crop or pixie can create an illusion of more hair on top. There’s also the added benefit of crop or pixie just being easier to style in general with the right cut for texture.”</p><h3><strong>9.
