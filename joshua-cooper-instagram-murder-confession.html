Cops then found a deceased 13-year-old female in the bathroom, with an apparent gunshot wound to the chest, according to an affidavit of probable cause for Cooper's arrest (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>). The victim was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly identified</a> by her parents thanks to the jewelry she was wearing.</p><p>"There were also indications that substantial steps were taken to clean up the crime scene," said police, who later located Cooper and charged him as an adult with criminal homicide, possessing instruments of crime and tampering with or fabricating physical evidence.

Per the Inquirer, he also told authorities that "[his] dad is going to kill [him]."</p><p>Cooper reportedly told police he accessed his father's safe "by replacing the batteries that his father had removed, which had made the combination lock inoperable" and removed and reorganized the firearms and ammunition inside the morning of the teen's death. The criminal complaint also said Cooper told cops the victim came over and the pair watched a Netflix series together, before she left him to use the rest room. Though he allegedly said he didn't accompany her to the bathroom, Cooper and his mother "terminated" the interview at that point.</p><p>Cooper will appear in court on December 7.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c4f479c1-8a54-4d20-b2b0-9b5593f6bb25 data-container-ref=toofab:article:29f02005-7a6c-42af-b9bf-a6582650fb8e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3d/5by4/2022/11/19/3d0cc0d483e74a18b0b0128935626c29_xs.png width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube / 11Alive</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Death Ruled Suicide for Mom Found Naked and Burned After Sending Chilling Text to Daughter</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpma3Ffn7y0tNSaZJynn6Wys3nIp6qtmZenrq55zK6pnZ2iYrCwusWeqqyhn6N8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./garden-ideas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>21 Free Garden Design Ideas and Plans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reba-mcentire-speaks-out-as-taylor-swift-called-an-entitled-little-brat-in-cruel-post.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reba McEntire speaks out as Taylor Swift called an 'entitled little brat' in cruel post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
