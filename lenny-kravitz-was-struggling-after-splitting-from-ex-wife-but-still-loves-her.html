Without a lot being said, there was magnetism. I’d never had an encounter like it before. We were from the same tribe.”</p><p>They tied the knot in Las Vegas in November, 1987, however, despite sparks flying between them when they first met, they separated in 1991 and divorced two years later. But that hasn’t stopped Lenny Kravitz from still having a deep love for his wife and ex-partner.</p><p>He said: “Zoë’s mom and I now are best friends. It’s interesting because that’s how the relationship started. It makes you feel really good when you can do that. When we’re all together now.”</p><p>But he admits it took a while to get to this stage.</p><p>“It took time, believe me, but she is a part of my life that will never leave my heart, my soul or my spirit. I am what I am because of our experience,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> earlier this month.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lenny-kravitz-and-his-ex-wife-share-a-daughter>Lenny Kravitz and his ex-wife share a daughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1208662862-1024x682.jpg><p>Lenny and his ex-wife only had one child together, Zoë Kravitz, who has followed in her parents’ footsteps. She starred in Big Little Lies, The Batman as well as X-Men <a href=#>movies</a>.</p><p>Although Lenny’s fame began with <a href=#>music</a>, he has made a mark in the film business too. He starred as Cinna in The Hunger Games franchise alongside <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a>.</p><p>And the 59-year-old has a strong relationship with his daughter.</p><p>“She’s amazing, and she’s all the things that I would have hoped for,” he added.</p><p>“I’m a dad, you know, but we’re friends. We’re very close. We talk about everything. We don’t hide things from each other.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-says-their-time-together-was-beautiful>He says their time together was ‘beautiful’</h2><p>“We were quite the family,” Lenny Kravitz said about his time with ex-wife Lisa and daughter Zoe.</p><p>“We had our own groove, expression, fashion. It was a beautiful time. The world Zoë’s mom and I were creating, our family, it was about peace, love and spirit.”</p><p>Although they broke up almost 15 years ago, they’re still good friends. He said he was struggling emotionally after they split when they married young, but they worked together to make sure they were still close.</p><p>“The love doesn’t leave you, but it has to find a new way to funnel itself into a new life,” he added.</p><p>“We consciously wanted to do that. It took time, believe me, but she is a part of my life that will never leave my heart, my soul or my spirit. I am what I am because of our experience.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lenny-kravitz-list-of-partners-include-model-and-famous-movie-star>Lenny Kravitz list of partners include model and ‘famous movie star’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-169982031-1024x744.jpg><p>Lenny, whose parents were also in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>, has had a celebrity-filled love life.</p><p>Before Lenny Kravitz married his ex-partner Lisa, he reportedly dated Kylie Minogue for a short spell in 1991. Although the singers never responded to the claims.</p><p>The follow year he began dating Vanessa Paradis, between 1992 and 1997, after the French star sought him out to produce her first English album. Although neither of the pair opened up over their split at the time, Lenny did later say he was “madly in love” with the star, but “she came at the wrong time”. He would introduce Paradis to <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>, and the pair went on to date for 14 years and share two children.</p><p>Then in 2002, he was <a href=# rel=nofollow>linked</a> to Nicole Kidman, but Lenny Kravitz’ Hollywood partner wasn’t known for almost 15 years later. They even got engaged, but kept it all under wraps, but unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be as they later broke up too.</p><p>The movie star <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> in 2007 they “weren’t ready” to get married, but kept the name hush-hush.</p><p>In 2018, he was linked to Brazilian model Barbara Fialho, but it’s believed they called it quits before they reached their first anniversary.</p><p>After, rumors flew he was dating <a href=#>Halle Berry</a>, but neither of them confirmed the news, so that seems to live on as the typical speculation that surrounds <a href=#>celebrity couples</a>.</p><p>Lisa on the other hand had a long-term relationship with marvel star <a href=#>Jason Momoa</a>. They got together in 2005, married in 2017 and <a href=#>announced they had separated</a> in 2022.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2aGcLjEp6WyZZunrre107NksJmjYsC1vtSgnqWhnpx6orLTnqlmq6ChtrXAyKeeZp6ipLpusddmrqKelWKvtsCMrKuipJxiubDCxKxkoZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./like-father-like-daughter-why-vanessa-kerry-is-demanding-action-on-climate-and-health.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Like father, like daughter: why Vanessa Kerry is demanding action on climate and health | Global dev</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ginger-zee-wows-figure-hugging-dress-wilma-flintstone-gma-style.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ginger Zee's figure-hugging dress belongs in the Flintstones - and we love it!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
