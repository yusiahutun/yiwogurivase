"Finally I went in for my yearly OB/GYN check, I was for sure this was going to be the end and they were going to tell me, 'You're going through the change.'"</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the Mayo Clinic</strong></a>, menopause is defined as "The time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles. It's diagnosed after you've gone 12 months without a menstrual period."</p><p>While Mellencamp did not specify what her menstrual cycles had been like, she told followers she was "constantly bleeding" and experiencing "mood swings."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"'That's why you're not sleeping. That's why you're constantly bleeding. That's why you're having mood swings.' The list goes on and on," she added. Mellencamp then revealed that, "my numbers came back and everything's fine."</p><p>Instead, she said, the symptoms she had been experiencing were deemed by her doctor to be as a result of her copper IUD. "It's potentially from my copper IUD," she said of the implanted contraceptive device, used by the mother-of-three, and countless other women, to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>She then turned to her followers and asked for their advice and experiences with the copper IUD.</p><p>"Guys, tell me about your symptoms from the copper IUD. Did this happen to you?," Mellencamp, who has previously opened up about her <a href=#><strong>battle with skin cancer</strong></a>, asked before making light of the situation.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2029e80b-af6c-49c8-b643-6e0cd77289fb data-container-ref=toofab:article:5e9889d9-3ed4-4a4d-aa03-274316085424 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/da/5by4/2023/12/28/da8b961189c440f4bd5b7becfeb42931_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teddi Mellencamp in 'A Lot of Damn Pain' After 'Biggest Surgery' Yet in Ongoing Skin Cancer Battle</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Who would've thought I'm a spring chicken?," she joked.</p><p>She then referenced her husband, Edwin Arroyave, and typed, "Also, the fact that @tedwinator thought this new information meant we would have another baby is hilarious."</p><p>Mellencamp and Arroyave, who have been married since 2011, and share son Cruz, 9, as well as daughters Slate, 11, and Dove, 4.
