She took home the St John Knits Award for Ready-to-Wear, presented by St John Knits global CEO Andy Lew and tennis legend Maria Sharapova.

When Lenny Kravitz won the CFDA's Icon Award last year, he was notably dripping in L'Enchanteur jewels. Founded by twins Soull and Dynasty Ogun, the Brooklyn-based brand won the Jewelry Award, presented by actor Tracee Ellis Ross. Soull and Dynasty started their brand with the goal of incorporating spirituality into everything they create. They both had formal jobs in design at 3.1 Phillip Lim, but their creative careers began much earlier; as children, they would transform their mother's hair decorations into jewelry.</p><img alt="los angeles, california march 21 soull ogun and dynasty ogun speak onstage during the fashion trust us awards 2023 at goya studios on march 21, 2023 in los angeles, california photo by charley gallaygetty images for fashion trust us" title="Fashion Trust U.S. Awards 2023" width=4838 height=3225 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/l-enchanteur-641b69847e7b4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Charley Gallay</span><p>Twins Soull and Dynasty Ogun of L'Enchanteur jewels accepted the Fashion Trust US Jewelry Award.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Graduate award, sponsored by Google and presented by Law Roach, went to Papa Oppong, a 31-year-old from Ghana with a MFA in Fashion Design from the Fashion Institute.
