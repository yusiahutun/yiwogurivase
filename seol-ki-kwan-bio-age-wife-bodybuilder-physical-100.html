And now, he’s finally putting his muscles to the test on Netflix’s new show </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span>. Will he succeed? Only time can tell.</span></p><p><span>But for now, enjoy this Seol Ki-Kwan Bio and learn all about his private life.</span></p><h3><b>Seol Ki-Kwan On Netflix’s Physical 100</b></h3><p><span>If you love </span><i><span>The Squid Game</span></i><span> (the show or the series) then you’ll love </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span>, where 100 contestants, including Seol Ki-Kwan, from various ethnicities, ages, and gender come together to compete against each other and prove their physical strength. But it’s not just the title of “most perfect physique” that the victor takes home. They are also entitled to the winning money of 300 million won (approx USD 243 thousand).</span></p><p><span>“Fight to the death. Survive to the end.” These were the words that appeared in the show’s trailer. The contestants competed to survive purely with their physical strength.</span></p><p><span>In the first ep, Seol and other contestants were placed in a massive space where plaster casts of their torsos sat on marble pedestals, arranged in concentric circles around a fountain. They then walked around, admiring each other’s plaster/actual bodies, objectifying and judging each other.</span></p><p><span>Later, for the first challenge, the contestants then hung onto a suspended apparatus lifted in the air. Through this, the participants quickly realized that the show was not only a test of brute strength but also endurance and mental strength. Finally, based on how long they lasted, the players were then placed in order from 100 to 1, and in order, they got to choose who they’ll face in the first quest — a&nbsp; fight over a ball.</span></p><p><span>Overall, 50 matches took place in the same two arenas, just like </span><i><span>The Challenge</span></i><span>. Yet </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> stood apart from other gaming shows staging these in much more interesting ways and with a massive cast.</span></p><p><span>Before the show premiered on January 24, 2023, Seol took to his IG to write, “It’s going to be crazy, but the fight of Korea’s physical tops. Fight to the death and survive to the end. Regardless of gender, age, or race.”</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Seol Ki-Kwan?</b></h3><p><span>Seol Ki-Kwan was 39 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Physical 100</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He was one of the older contestants in the season. Even make a joke about it, he took to his IG whilst promoting the show to write, “I’m too old… I worked hard… Please give me episode 3 soon!! It’s so fun and curious!!”</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Seol and his co-contestant <a href=#>Agent H</a> are close.

Also, he wants to be a funny person, but “can’t make others laugh much.”</span></p><p><span>For those of you wondering, Seol’s muscles are all natural. He has never used any illegal drugs in his life.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, he graduated from Baejae in 2002 and later studied Golf Management at </span><i><span>Kyung Hee University</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Seol Ki-Kwan Wife</b></h3><p><span>Seol Ki-Kwan married his wife </span><a href=#><span>Hyewon Park</span></a><span> on September 24, 2011.

The children like to study, exercise, and eat chicken breast. Also, they liked to visit zoos and go to the movies.</span></p><p><span>The last we saw, the family of four was enjoying the snow in Dongtan New Town.&nbsp; “The kids were so excited because it snowed a lot in the morning.
