I really don’t get it," Owens said of the ad, which came out last year. "If I'm wrong again, educate me. Today, I just want to be educated in the comments… I don't know why this needs to be done.

This Candace person making comments about companies who see we need help. It's f---ing gross," she wrote, before giving a shoutout to brands, such as <a href=#>Kim Kardashian's </a>SKIMS, Neo-Walk sticks and Guide Beauty, whose founder Terri Bryant has Parkinson's, and Chief Creative Officer is <a href=#>Selma Blair</a>, who, like Applegate, has MS.</p><p>However, to Owens, Applegate said, "#youshouldknowbetter." The "Dead to Me" star continued to criticize Owens, writing that her "rage" was "keeping me awake."</p><p>"Candace Owens, do you know when you have seen pictures of me how f---ing hard it was to get my clothes on? A team has to help me!!!" she tweeted. "So I'm excited for accessibility clothing for me and my community.Hope u wake."</p><p>The 51-year-old actress went on to post a third tweet. "I thought my last tweet was enough. But then my heart said something else. No rage," Applegate said. "If Candace wants to get on the phone with me to be educated on being disabled. I will not come with anger. I will come with love. Because she needs to hear that. I pray for her tonight.sincerely."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yes late tweet.But woke to see the most horrifying thing.

Would welcome a discussion with you. DMs open," Owens wrote.</p><p>She continued, "I think Christina, that what you may have missed is that covering absurd DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion] initiatives is a recurring beat on my show."</p><p>Owens claimed that she didn't know the "particular ad featured a specific technology designed for people with disabilities, which was an honest mistake," adding, "What we thought it was at the time, was another nonsensical 'representation matters' DEI initiative which I strongly feel patronizes the people it purports to represent. (Example: clinically obese people modeling swimsuits). This wasn't that and we simply got it wrong."</p><p>The podcast host said her and her team "create show 5 days a week," noting that it's "an impossibility that we would not at some point make an honest mistake."</p><p>She continued, "If you felt personally targeted by this mistake, I apologize to you. We simply did not know (the ad did not state) that the underwear was created for disabled access."</p><p>Applegate, it seems, wasn't buying Owens' "honest mistake" comment -- see her response after Candace's tweets below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey Christina— huge fan of yours.

I thought that was really, really interesting, that I somehow wanted to pursue disabled people and I somehow wanted them out of space," she said. "That is absolute nonsense."</p><p>She went on to call out Kardashian directly, posting the snippet from the podcast episode on Twitter.</p><p>"Do you actually believe [SKIMS founder] Kim Kardashian uses obese models because she wants to be inclusive’?" she wrote alongside the clip. "That she thinks the beauty standard needs to shift? No, she doesn't. She's checking off a box & making millions of dollars so she can get procedures to look nothing like them."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Do you actually believe Kim Kardashian uses obese models because she wants to be "inclusive"?

At the same time, I was relearning simple tasks like clothing myself. It would have been so helpful to see someone in a wheelchair; I’m so happy that we’re finally coming around. Seeing someone like you matters; representation matters."</p><p>Like Applegate, Rosa offered to "educate" Owens on the topic. "Wheelchair users will not agree with [Owen'’] views," she said. "If [Owens] truly wants to educate herself, she can reach out to me. I’m not one for cancel culture; I believe in the power of education. I’d love to have a conversation and educate Candace."</p><a id=gallery-link-e5625fdd-2878-416d-bd0b-e2ec666ac070 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:e5625fdd-2878-416d-bd0b-e2ec666ac070 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ddb62013-6877-4baa-845d-367e1a3804c3 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d6/4by3/2023/12/21/d6b882ed24d048c4ba81fe4d1a66e4e9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma2tfmLWztdKtoKeZXZa9sbjEoJitnV2ouaK50maamqaUlrCmec6wnKerXZi%2FqsDInKCspV2ouKq50mauoZ2VobCprcirZJqcXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-young-bio-love-island-height-family-dating-status.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Get To Know Love Island Will Young!
