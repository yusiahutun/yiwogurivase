In 2005, there was one from Nigella Lawson <a href=#>in the New York Times</a> with <a href=#>toasted hazelnuts, grain mustard, lime and orange and sesame oil</a>. My husband and I were a relatively new thing at the time and he wasn’t terribly into endive but he ate it politely for weeks and weeks, and eventually came around, or caved. Same thing, right?</p><p><span id=more-34428></span><br><a title="what you'll need" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4550/25115961978_1d7eaa3865_z.jpg alt="what you'll need" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Nine years later, I surprised my husband with a weekend in Miami for his birthday, although I hadn’t realized when I booked it four months earlier that I would be pregnant at the time and unable to enjoy so many of the culinary wonders of José Andrés’ Bazaar — tartares and raw oysters and his signature gin and tonic and no I’m not still mad about it, you’re still mad about it and want a do-over. The endive salad with orange segments, goat cheese, almonds and chives made up for a whole lot; I couldn’t get enough of it and it made it at least 18 more times when I came home, and <a href=#>demanded you make it too</a>. (I still maintain that nothing goes better with <a href=#>the latke course</a> at any Hanukah lunch or dinner gathering, a lightweight contrast.)</p><p><a title="torn bread, any old kind" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4598/25115961838_b663b97d10_n.jpg alt="torn bread, any old kind" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="chunky breadcrumbs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4588/25115961598_85993ccbe5_n.jpg alt="chunky breadcrumbs" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="sliced endive" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4553/25115961298_89f5dbfb90_n.jpg alt="sliced endive" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="lightly dressed endive petals" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4530/25115961058_57a6b90784_n.jpg alt="lightly dressed endive petals" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Which brings us to the year 2017 and a date night at Estela. Because I’m really hip and have many clues, the restaurant had been around for years before I realized it was right in our neighborhood, so we went on a whim and didn’t really know what to expect, such as not to go without a reservation unless you enjoy idling in a cramped space. I commented that the place looked like the restaurant looked designed by J.Crew — preppy somehow but also happy to be in the background or maybe those are the same things I don’t know anything about fashion, okay? While we waited for our space, plates of endive leaves kept going by arranged like towers of petals, seemingly ordered by everyone. They looked so plain, as if they too were trying to disappear into the background, but I knew better, that entire restaurants don’t order plates of raw endive unless they know something we don’t. When we finally got our turn to order it we found out that at the bottom of that nest was a pile of crunchy, salty, glorious harmony with crushed, crunchy croutons, toasted walnuts, bits of soft funky cheese, crumbs of salty hard cheese, and a deeply salty vinaigrette with a hint of orange. We scooped it onto the endive leaves and ate them with our hands and I can’t even tell you what else we ordered, only that it was all very good and equally playful, but this is the thing I’ve talked about since. I’m not sure why it took me so long to actually Google it because had I, I would have realized that the chef Ignacio Mattos had generously shared <a href=#>this and other winter salad recipes</a> with Bon Appetit nearly four years ago and that nobody is ever going to make it because of what I tell you next: It has anchovies in it. Several.</p><p><a title="chopped walnuts, diced taleggio" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4638/25115960828_636266b301_z.jpg alt="chopped walnuts, diced taleggio" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Now that it’s just us two in the room, look, I know everyone says anchovies “aren’t fishy” and “you’ll never taste them” but I won’t even try. Just know that I’m probably one of the more fish-hesitant people you’ll meet (my people are from landlocked places, okay?) and I know small, pungent, hairy-seeming fish aren’t even trying to win us over but good for them because that leaves more of this for us. They’re wonderful here. They’re not, however, everything. The dressing is all about the walnuts, cheese, and croutons but they provide the background punch and saltly amplificaiton and yet there’s enough going on that I hadn’t actually called it out as an anchovy dressing until I read the recipe. Thus, I’ll also tell you that if nobody is ever going to convince you to eat anchovies, the most solid non-fish substitute I’ve found for anchovies is salted capers. Rinse and mince them up (about 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped) as you would the tinned fish and continue; it’s unlikely anyone but Matteo himself, or possibly <a href=#>this lady</a>, will be the wiser.</p><p><a title="the blissful dressing" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4738/25115960638_42ce93552e_z.jpg alt="the blissful dressing" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="endive salad with toasted walnuts and breadcrumbs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4577/24122710537_32be9f38a7_z.jpg alt="endive salad with toasted walnuts and breadcrumbs" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h5></h5><p>Wait, has it been quiet around here or something?
