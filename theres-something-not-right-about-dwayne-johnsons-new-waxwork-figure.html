He then left the ring for the cameras and has since starred in a number of hit <a href=#>movies</a>, including Fast & Furious. However, maybe his latest waxwork isn’t one to add to the CV.

Are you going to visit him?”</p><p>Although, it doesn’t seem like this Dwayne will be getting many visitors from the comments.</p><p>“That’s not the Rock that’s the Pebble,” joked one.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, guys, but the rock looks like he got food poisoning,” another wrote.</p><p>One disappointed fan commented: “Not one of your best guys – considering the quality of the rest of the museum, there’s something not right about the sculpt on this.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-won-a-public-competition>The star ‘won a public competition’</h2><p>To add to the disappointment, it seems as if Dwayne was actually voted for by the public to have a waxwork made of him in the museum, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as per</a> The Daily Mail.</p><p>The publication reports that he was in the running with huge A-Listers including <a href=#>music</a> stars Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, and <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, plus <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> Zendaya and Tom Holland.</p><p>As of yet, it doesn’t look like the star has flown over to see the waxwork, and after he sees the comments from fans, he may pass up the offer.</p><p>It’s not the first waxwork figure the WWE legend has. He’s also proudly standing in Madame Tussauds London and Beijing.</p><p>It looks like the Jumanji Star had some input, as the website <a href=# rel=nofollow>states</a>: “We worked closely with the man himself to perfect his new figure, right down to his million-dollar smile.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aEcMDHnqmeq12ovK6x06Ggp59do7y1edGinqGsXZavsMHTZpuwmamjsm62zqGlrKeeqHqvsdZmrpqwp6S%2FrHnFop6uqpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keyconcepts-pimple-patches-amazon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These $10 Pimple Patches From Amazon Zap Blemishes 'Overnight'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-gifts-for-caregivers-168291.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Gifts for Caregivers That Show How Much You Care</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
