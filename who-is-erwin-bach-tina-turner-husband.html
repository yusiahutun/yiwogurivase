Along her journey to healing, Turner found the love of her life, her second husband, Erwin Bach, who has been by her side for decades now.

He was sent by her longtime manager, Roger Davies, to pick her up from the airport. In the HBO documentary, Turner recalls instantly being drawn to him. “My heart went bah-boom,” she says. “It means that a soul has met, and my hands were shaking. And Roger said to me, ‘Tina, you ride with Erwin,’ and I wanted to go, ‘Yay!’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She elaborates further, saying, “He was just so different, so laid back, so comfortable, so unpretentious, and that was the beginning of our relationship.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thirty-five years later, Erwin professes in TINA that the pair are still just as madly in love, “It’s love, it’s something we both have for each other. I always refer to it as an electrical charge. I still have it. I still have it even though when I left her two hours ago, three hours ago, this morning, I still have that feeling. That feeling is still with me. It’s in my heart. I feel very warm about this.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Erwin donated a kidney to Tina after she started experiencing severe health issues.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In her 2018 memoir, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/My-Love-Story-Tina-Turner/dp/1501198246 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="My Love Story" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">My Love Story</a>, Turner revealed that two years earlier, increased high blood pressure was causing her kidneys to function at 20 percent and that they were “plunging rapidly.” Recalling coming to grips with the possibility of death, Turner shared that it was Bach who stepped up and offered to donate one of his own kidneys to her rather than the star having to undergo dialysis—it was a gesture Turner once referred to as “the gift of life.”</p><img alt="tina turner at spago's restaurant in hollywood, california august 13, 1985" title="Tina Turner at Spago's Restaurant in Hollywood, California - August 13, 1985" width=2002 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/erwin-bach-and-tina-turner-during-tina-turner-at-spagos-news-photo-1617135967.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ron Galella, Ltd.</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Bach and Turner circa 1985 in Hollywood.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They married 27 years after they became a couple.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the couple first met in the mid 1980s, they didn’t officially wed until 27 years later.

Turner wore a decadent Giorgio Armani dress embellished with Swarovski crystals and requested that all the women attendees wear white and male attendees wear black-tie evening wear. Following the nuptials, Turner revealed that she was in a constant state of Nirvana because of the joy she gets from her encouraging husband, whom she describes as “a force of nature in his own right, has never been the least bit intimidated by my career, my talents, or my fame.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He has dabbled in acting and producing.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bach briefly took up acting, landing a role in the 1999 film Maldito amor: Demasiado tarde.
