Fans of Frank started noticing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his weight loss</a> even before he left the <a href=#>popular TV show</a>. He appeared thinner than he was they first saw him scrounging through trash looking for treasure on the screen. However, it wasn’t something significant to cause worry.</p><p class=align-left>Frank’s noticeable weight loss occurred in 2013. The concerns grew, and Frank was forced to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hop on Facebook</a> and respond to his fans in an enlightening response:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7c7895f77ecb4ccb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cody Rigsby net worth, income, career, and property in 2022</span></p></a>A lot of you have been wondering about my health and my weight loss. I have an illness called Crohn’s [disease], which at times is difficult to deal with. I started losing weight and ran with it! I have been exercising and eating good… Thanks for all your kind words of concern! I couldn't do what I do without all of you!<p class=align-left>Frank stated that handling the disease was difficult, but he had learned to manage it over the years. Another reason that <a href=#>Frank Fritz</a> lost a lot of weight is because of the changes he has made in his life.</p><p class=align-left>In July 2021, Frank shared more details about his weight loss transformation during an exclusive <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with The Sun</a>. At the time, he had already lost 65 pounds. He stated:</p>The weight loss is me watching what I'm eating so I can keep my disease under control the best I can. I'm just eating healthy. After a while, I started watching what I was doing and doing a little bit more walking. I also keep pretty busy around here, taking care of the grass and getting rid of the weeds. Not drinking helps with weight loss because when you drink, you eat. I'm not dieting. I was drinking a little bit too, but I needed something else. I haven't had a drink in almost nine or ten months. It would have been a year, but I had one slip-up. It was maybe for four hours, but it was enough.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/714aca73dd403e5b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amy Ferson's life story, divorce, husband, children, and career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The reality TV star also blamed his heavy drinking on his break up with long-time girlfriend turned ex-fiancé Diann Bankson.</p><h2>Frank Fritz health update</h2><p class=align-left>Before Frank came out clean about his health and explained to his fans what was ailing him, there was a lot of speculation about his weight loss. Until his revelation, nobody would have guessed it and the question, “Does Frank Fritz have Crohns?” was hardly imaginable. It only came about after he spoke about it.</p><p class=align-left>The popular reality TV star is still managing the disease and has toned down on a few things, including alcohol. He is also staying away from certain foods. However, he is not dieting as most people assume.</p><p class=align-left>The latest health issue about Frank Fritz is that he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suffered a stroke</a>, which left him hospitalized.

During an interview with The Sun, he talked about getting back on the screen 65-pound lighter would be a big deal.</p>That was a big thing about coming back to the show. How can I come back to the show 65lbs lighter? I would like to come back to the show, but we will see. I have been doing it for 11 years, but there is a lot of controversy going on right now. It is up to the network whether I come back on the show. It ain’t gonna affect me one bit.
