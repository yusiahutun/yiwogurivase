Here, learn how this ancient plant can transform your health.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The history of the red sage plant as a health booster</h2><p>The red sage plant grows along grassy hillsides and streams in countries such as China and Japan. It boasts violet-hued flowers, but the roots are the real health-boosting star: Red sage gets its name from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">color of the root</a>, and it’s actually part of the mint family. And while red sage isn’t used in cooking like the common sage plant, you can get the benefits in supplement form.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>“Red sage is one of the most well-known and widely used Chinese herbs and has been used medicinally for thousands of years,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Melina Jampolis, MD,</a> a physician nutrition specialist in Los Angeles, cofounder and chief medical officer of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ahara</a>, and author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spice Up, Live Long</a>. “It’s derived from the root of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">salvia miltiorrhiza</a> plant. It’ widely known to support healthy circulation and healthy immune function.”</p><p>In an early <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese pharmacy book </a>dating as far back as 221 BC, red sage was cited as a highly valued, non-toxic “super grade herb.” It was used alone or with a combination of other medicinal plants for a variety of illnesses. These medical issues ran the gamut: It helped treat <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blood circulation problems and insomnia</a>, as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and gynecological diseases</a>. Today, red sage is still an incredibly popular natural remedy in China.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/shutterstock_1399208195-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What makes the red sage plant a super herb</h2><p>“Red sage contains various medicinal components that contribute to its potential health benefits,” explains <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Abigail Basson, Ph.D, RD</a>, a registered dietitian and instructor of research in the department of nutrition at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.&nbsp; “There are various <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">phytochemical</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bioactive compounds</a> in red sage such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flavonoids</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">salvianoic acid</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">phenol acid</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tanshinones</a>. These have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardiovascular protection properties,” says Basson. &nbsp;She adds that red sage’s essential oils, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sterols</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">polysaccharides</a> also aid in red sage’s health promoting properties.</p><p>The hundreds of bioactive components in red sage plant are grouped into two main types, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diterpenoids</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">phenolics</a>, says Dr. Jampolis. “Both are phytonutrients, chemical compounds found in plants. Besides their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory content, diterpenoids also have anti-microbial and anti-tumor properties. And the phenolics in red sage help reduce blood clotting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/shutterstock_1723251004-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The health benefits of the red sage plant</h2><p>Staying healthy head-to-toe has never been easier. Here’s how supplementing with red sage can help.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It keeps your heart strong</h3><p>“Red sage is primarily known for its beneficial effects on cardiovascular health via the active compounds salvianolic acids and tanshinones,” says Basson. “It has traditionally been used to promote blood circulation, regulate blood pressure, and support heart health. Research suggests that red sage may help dilate blood vessels, reduce inflammation, and prevent blood clot formation.”</p><p>According to research in Current Pharmaceutical Design, it may help in treatment of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">acute coronary syndrome</a>. This umbrella term refers to conditions where blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked, such as a heart attack or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unstable angina</a>. In a meta-analysis in Frontiers in Pharmacology, researchers found that red sage taken in conjunction with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prescription heart medications</a> significantly improved the therapeutic effects in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

A study in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine examined the effects of red sage in patients with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary heart disease</a>. Researchers found those who took 27 mg of red sage in pill-form three times a day lowered their “bad” LDL cholesterol 15 points and boosted their “good” HDL cholesterol 7 points. Plus, they lowered their total cholesterol 35 points and reduced their triglycerides 13 points in three months.</p><p>“It makes sense that red sage supports numerous aspects of heart health because anything that reduces inflammation, has antioxidant activity and minimizes blood clotting can help reduce the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries and heart attacks,” explains Dr. Jampolis.

And when the organ is bogged down, it can hamper your mood, metabolism and energy. That’s why it’s so important to keep this hard-working organ in tip-top shape. Enter red sage.</p><p>Research in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity suggests that red sage may reduce <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">liver damage</a> caused by toxins, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">oxidative stress</a> and inflammation, says Basson. “Red sage may also support liver function and promote liver regeneration, although further research is needed.” (Click through to our sister site to discover how <a href=#>healing a fatty liver can speed fat burn 400%.</a>)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It keeps your memory sharp</h3><p>The red sage plant’s active antioxidant and anti-inflammatory may have neuroprotective properties that shield brain cells from damage. This can improve cognitive function and have potential protective effects for conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke recovery, says Basson.</p><p>A review in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience suggests red sage can significantly improve neurological function, sharpening <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">memory and cognitive abilities</a> in people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vascular cognitive impairment</a> is when your memory and thinking ability is hampered due to blood vessel changes in the brain. It can range from relatively minor memory lapses to dementia. Researchers suspect credit goes to red sage’s ability to boost circulation and eliminate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blood stasis</a>, when blood can’t flow properly through the body’s tissues.

Plus keeping bones strong has been shown to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce your risk of back pain </a>and even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">curb your risk of hearing loss</a> 44% by preserving tiny sound-conducting bones in the ear.</p><p>Red sage can deliver on all those benefits as it helps bone stay strong as you get older. A study in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research found compounds in red sage inhibit an enzyme called&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cathepsin K</a>&nbsp;(CatK), slowing its ability to break down existing bone. The payoff: a 35% increase in bone mineral density. (Click through to our sister site to see <a href=#>six more ways to bolster your bones.</a>)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/shutterstock_2272763051-2.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It helps ward off cancer</h3><p>Basson says red sage and its active components are being studied for their potential anticancer properties. “Studies suggest that red sage extracts may exhibit anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apoptosis-inducing</a> effects on various cancer cells, including breast, lung, liver, and colon cancer cells,” she says. This means red sage may inhibit potentially cancerous cell growth and help rid the body of damaged cells.</p><p>Dr. Jampolis says all herbs and spices play a role on some level on cancer initiation. This can be caused by damage from oxidative stress and inflammation, which has been linked to cancer.&nbsp; “Red sage may also help slow the growth and spread of tumors through several ways including inducing cell death and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blocking the creation of blood vessels required to feed tumor cells</a>.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to get the benefits of the red sage plant</h2><p>You can take red sage in a variety of ways, including capsules, tablets, tinctures, in powder form and as a tea. Which form you take depends on personal choice and how much red sage you consume. Dr. Jampolis says using a red sage tea is going to give you the least concentrated dose. Why? It depends on how long you steep it or how hot the water is. Teas and tinctures are more for prevention than optimal health, Dr. Jampolis explains.</p><p>“A tea will be less potent than a tincture, which is more concentrated. If you’re really looking to take red sage therapeutically, I’d go with a capsule or tablet,” Dr. Jampolis says.&nbsp;She also suggests choosing a product that’s third party tested and certified by a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer lab</a>.
