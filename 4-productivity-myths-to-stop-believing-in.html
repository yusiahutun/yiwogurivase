For the longest time, we have heard almost all ways to increase our productivity.</p><p>Managing your time, making your 24 hours count, cutting down on your screen time, and waking up just when the sun does are parts of the many pieces of unsolicited advice, we may receive to increase our productivity. Countless influencers online come up with videos and articles suggesting zillions of ways to take on the world. Through this article, let us try and bust some of the well-known productivity myths that may not help you rise and shine.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Myth#1: Emulate Successful People</h6><p>Multiple videos surf online educating us about the habits of successful people on the planet. Now these videos should provoke us to ask many questions. The first and foremost, though, should be questioning the statistical relevance of these claims. Are they statistically sound? if they are not, how can one claim that this is one of the solutions to your procrastination? Apart from its probable statistical irrelevance, these tips could also spread a very problematic thought of worthlessness and inferiority.</p><p>Furthermore, it may even promote the belief that one’s efforts are never enough to be successful. Thus, they may undermine their efforts and may become frustrated towards the work. It is very humane to feel inspired by the actions and habits of people whom we look up to as role models. But, the line between deriving inspiration from their productivity methods and, idolizing them, emulating their habits to a toxic extent, should never be blurred in our minds. The latter could lead us to forget that these people were the product of their time and circumstances, which are never identical to ours, thus, copying their behavioural patterns word by word may never turn out to be the solution for your productivity concerns.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>How to boost your productivity with Pomodoro Technique</a></p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Myth#2: Early to bed, Early to rise</h6><p>&nbsp;Advice like “wake up at 4 am” or “do not sit too late at night” is never a suitable prototype for all individuals and obviously not a one-stop solution for the seemingly unproductive life. People, no matter whether they choose to be a morning bird or a night owl, ought to take care of their sleep cycles, food habits, and physical exercises, to remain focused and productive throughout the day. This will help them ensure that these cycles do not disturb the homeostasis of their physical bodies and do not make them vulnerable to lifestyle disorders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, one’s choice to be a morning or night person is never really a choice in their hands.</p><p>They are built likewise. It is their inherited internal body clock that determines one’s circadian cycles and tame them to be morning bird or night owl. To wake up early or to sleep late, is just there in their genes. Fighting one’s body clock to conform to another standard that society conveniently imposed on people, would surely make them less productive. It is hence, pivotal to match one’s internal clocks with their schedule and remain focused during specific hours one dedicates to work to hone one’s productivity.</p><p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=#>Building Habits that Stick: A deep dive into Psychology</a></p><h6 class=wp-block-heading><br>Myth#3: Make the most out of every moment</h6><p>“Why are you sitting idle? Don’t you have some work? Don’t waste your time! Finish it ASAP!”</p><p>This is that one dialogue that all of us must have uniformly heard from our homes, schools, colleges, workplaces, and whatnot, from time immemorial. These dialogues seemed to have normalised our belief that we can level up our productivity game by squeezing out each moment from every second the clock ticks. Instead of struggling to quantify every second in one’s life, choose a particular time slot within which one’s focus seems to be the maximum to get their tasks done productively.</p><p>Keeping a close track of the number of hours one’s attention and focus span is at its best and the time of the day they fall in would help them set their energy apart for the important tasks of the day. Create personal calendars and schedules, rather than following pre-made “success-assuring schedules” found online. No one knows your targets, schedules, your attention, your interests and disinterests and whatnot, like you. A study conducted by Ernst and Young showed that the longer the vacation its employees took, the better their performance in the subsequent months turned out to be. This proves not everyone should quantify their moments into ticking bombs of productivity.</p><p><strong>Read: </strong><a href=#>The Psychology of Time Management and its importance</a></p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Myth#4: A good productivity app is a one-stop shop</h6><p>We, the citizens of today, depend hugely on apps and websites to get our lives on track in almost all aspects. Sustaining productivity has now become one of those in which we turn to social media websites for tips and more often to apps that people choose to mend their ways to be a fine productive person. But, the fact is that even when these apps largely aid us in navigating our paths in sustaining our productivity, these are never one-stop shops for the same. One should try and identify the obstructions they are facing to remain productive and subsequently try and develop personal interventions to address the same. If they are unable to, they can seek the help of these apps rather than spending a major chunk of their time trialling the app that fits them the best.</p><p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href=#>The Psychology Behind Motivation</a></p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h5><p>These productivity myths can turn out to be detrimental to one’s development in their professional and personal lives. Thus, it is imperative for us to actively unleash the possible facts behind them and ensure that we do not fall prey to the former. Busting these myths would help us to understand the complexities hidden behind the concept, gifting us the audacity to embrace our individual needs, and our mental health and therefore, give “productivity” our own definition.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>The Psychology of Routine: Experts Insights</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Small Yet Significant Ways to Grow as a</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>“From being peaceful to into pieces”: The Inner</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 28, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Mindful Eating: A Path to Healthier Relationships with</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 25, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Awareness</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Life Style</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Exercise Addiction: Balancing the Benefits and Risks for</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 22, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmbWWgp7ylwcKtoK%2BhpK56rsXToapmrJ9iwLW7z2aZnqSZmsOqusZmoKdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bling-empires-christine-chiu-heart-evangelista-dorothy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bling Empires Christine Chiu on Heart Evangelista, Dorothy Wang and season 2 of the crazy rich As</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./article-f7ca965a-e52b-11e9-bde6-934e49700671-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>William Wootton Bush | Obituaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
