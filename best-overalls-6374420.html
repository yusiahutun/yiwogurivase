It's funny: Lots of women admitted to secretly liking their overalls but not wanting anyone to know. The time has come, though, to start wearing our overalls proudly out of the house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also spoke with Pistola founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Grace Na</a>, designer and sewist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Aaronica B.

Everlane, known for its sustainable, fair trade basics, gives us a utilitarian, workwear-inspired overall that looks vintage but pairs well with a modern wardrobe. As one reviewer writes, "They look like a pair of overalls that could have been made [over] 100 years ago (when things were quality)!" They're made of heavy organic cotton, and in terms of function, they boast three pockets and adjustable shoulder straps. The stripe is a nice alternative to plain denim — a modern twist on a classic shape — and the exaggerated front pockets give a little more visual interest than usual. The extra-wide legs are fun and fashionable instead of something akin to a cow-milking uniform.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Organic cotton, elastane | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XL<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-lazutom-womens-loose-fit-casual-overall></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lazutom Women's Loose Fit Casual Overall</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lazutom Women's Loose Fit Casual Overall" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uxibQsfIBoPVn6c8GglpjbJ9YMw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lazutom-womens-loose-fit-casual-baggy-denim-bib-dungarees-overall--6af910d947ff4fb3af7f27e335c44db2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has many sizes to choose from, so everyone can get a good deal.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It only comes in two colors, and it's not very adjustable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your budget is a bit more modest but you'd still like to channel "classic workwear with a modern twist" vibes, this Amazon option has a terrific design. The fit is loose and baggy, with four functional pockets. But on the downside, it's hand-wash-only, and it has a rigid, no-stretch construction, so you might want to consider going up a size for a baggy look and feel. The snaps on the shoulder mean that this pair isn't quite as adjustable as others on this list, but it's still a great basic for $30. It's also a nice place to start if you want to try the trend for the first time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Denim | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–3XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-hudson-jeans-utility-wide-leg-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hudson Jeans Utility Wide-Leg Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hudson Jeans Utility Wide-Leg Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5nJUghJbYdH2Y1yEYsuFyegqtVM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hudson-jeans-utility-wide-leg-overalls-63f2c2a6b1064029bcb20b32c96b836d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This leatherette look is an elevated, luxe take on the overall.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The material isn't as multifunctional as denim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fancy overalls, you say? Yes, and the key is to select a luxurious fabric with a cool color. These super-wide-leg pants with cargo pockets are very of-the-moment but will also be stylish in several years, thanks to the ubiquity of the black color and leather-like fabric. In case the cost is making you do a double take, just know: When you're going with a higher-end item like this one and you get it in a classic shape and style, you'll be able to wear it with more — meaning the price per wear will be lower. Women surveyed liked the overalls more than the rompers, so you can find a multitude of contexts for these.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-modern-pistola-arden-relaxed-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Modern</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pistola Arden Relaxed Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pistola Arden Relaxed Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5auru0lG3qzXyt3dJUwv3Nu8Txw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-2024-01-05T135647.629-f9d3ea3e8e55478c8b1204a807c50b6c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pistola</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The classic shape melds with the modern piece-y design.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> There isn't any stretch, which means you might need to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Na explains that for the Arden overalls, the design team took inspiration from classic workwear, particularly with the double knee feature. "We don’t expect anyone to do heavy lifting while wearing them, but adding features like this makes them feel more elevated and different than your everyday piece," she says. This is a particularly nice choice if you want to add feminine or fitted details: a more polished shoe, for example, or a tight lace shirt underneath. The design has very wide openings on the side, meaning it won't get bunchy or tight through the chest, abdomen, or hips. This is, in other words, a great choice for your office, and — so long as it's amenable to casual wear — you'll feel great in these all day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-free-people-hudson-jeans-utility-wide-leg-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Hudson Jeans Utility Wide-Leg Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Hudson Jeans Utility Wide-Leg Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Qt1V3EcUnrOl5QcAt4ZtKl50-dU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign-2024-01-05T135431.845-970dc84d62c34e8eb633c57677aa625c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The style has not one but three classic denim colors, and it's a best seller.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It runs long and can be tight through the body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have the most basic overalls on your Pinterest board, this pair is a pretty solid choice. Each of the three colors is a "classic" denim style (meaning you can't go wrong, regardless of which one you pick). It's a non-stretch style with pockets galore — five, to be exact. It's extremely cuff-able, meaning the pant leg rolls easily, which helps with the generally casual vibe of the overalls. Reviewers write that it's a great value for the money, and even though it's a bit pricier than they might usually pay for an overall, they wear this piece all the time. The fabric isn't too thick, which is great for layering but may also make these a good spring through fall choice instead of winter overalls.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-everyday-quince-organic-stretch-cotton-twill-relaxed-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Everyday</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince Organic Stretch Cotton Twill Relaxed Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quince Organic Stretch Cotton Twill Relaxed Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2yGC2MAIRl1vG0bYmaUt_D8Fn18=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quince--organic-stretch-cotton-twill-relaxed-overalls-259ce8a8b9ae4abdb028a0a4063b7225.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These are the "chicest" overalls on this list.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> You still might need to size down a little.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Quince has affordable basics that aren't fast fashion, so if you want a budget pick that's certified to a higher factory and material standard, this is a nice choice. The sleek, true-to-size construction is very basic — but, on the other hand, the lack of bells and whistles makes the white color look extremely chic (it's also a nice touch that the buttons are gold-toned) and overall easy to style. The legs are straight in width instead of wide, making them look more traditional. Reviewers say this is the pair of overalls to get if most styles make you look boxy, and it’s not baggy — meaning it’s more polished and sleek. Yes, overalls can look chic!&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material</strong>: Organic cotton, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-organic-cotton-lucy--yak-original-dungaree></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Organic Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lucy & Yak Original Dungaree</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lucy &amp;amp; Yak Original Dungaree" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jUQPKcO6zFLr_IoL89ElG6SZJwM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lucy--yak--original-dungaree-06756e01c99a487094d3cad4bd028c0a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lucy & Yak&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This style has a lot of colors, inclusive sizing, and two leg lengths.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Some of the colors sell out quickly, especially in the extended sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This British brand is reasonably priced (particularly for the fact that it uses organic instead of regular cotton in the constructions), and its Original Dungaree style in particular comes in a wealth of colors, should you be interested in taking a non-blue style out for a spin. Just know that a few of the colors are especially popular (Fandango Pink in particular), so if you spot the color available in your size, make sure to grab it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It features a tie-strap construction, which is also a little more unusual than your average snap or buckle straps, but still allows for adjustability.

These are on the right thigh, left thigh, and back, with a pruner loop and bib storage system, phone sleeve, pencil slots, and sunglasses loop. This style is meant to be more practical — as in, if you're doing gardening or any other activity that requires durability and storage space, it’s your pick (there’s even UPF sun protection).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cole also loves these overalls because they're size-inclusive.

Case in point: Some reviewers bought these as part of a Halloween costume, and some of them bought them because they just love the color. Reviewers also add that this pair is incredibly comfortable, unlike the more rigid and non-stretch options on this list. The canvas is also roomier and more stretchy for those who need more room for their chest or torso, as well. It has extended sizes, which is a nice feature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 17 | <strong>Size:</strong> S–3XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skirt-cleo--wolf-womens-denim-skirtall></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skirt</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cleo + Wolf Women's Denim Skirtall</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cleo + Wolf Women's Denim Skirtall" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eaOc5bZNEUGUq5sVmF9Jg-CRSrs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cleo---wolf-womens-light-wash-denim-skirtall-f4d60499740545c3954c8679f28b7283.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bootbarn</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It has a nice shape and structure that'll work for several body types.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> This probably isn't a pair for cold-weather months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're unfamiliar, overalls don't have to be pants (or even shorts!). If you like skirts and want to give overalls a whirl, this "skirtall" is the same construction but with a skirt on the bottom. This is a pretty classic color and shape, which means you're still getting the traditional look and feel. The round hem is also super-classic, and the rough edge is a nice modern touch. Dare we say it: The skirtall is the cuter, slightly more chic version of the classic overall. So, if you've been hesitant to experiment with the style because your natural aesthetic leans more upscale and less trendy, this could be the overall you've been waiting for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, Lycra | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shorts-levis-vintage-womens-shortalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shorts</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's Vintage Women's Shortalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi's Vintage Women's Shortalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OXIOQDD27kvNlfA4cYOQnhTOeSk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-premium-vintage-womens-shortalls-61c17be33358420786ff7fc5575675ed.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Levi's&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Levi's makes high-quality denim, so if you're getting one pair of shortalls, this is a good option.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> This runs a little big but doesn't have any stretch, so it might require a little trial and error to get the size right.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps no brand is more associated with denim than Levi's, so it would make sense that it would have some classic overall selections. If you want some shortalls (short overalls), you don't need anything fancy. This style comes in three classic colors and has a longer length on the leg for maximum cuffing opportunities (or, if you'd rather not show off some leg, the length works for that too). Reviewers of all ages love this traditional look in particular for the spring and summer months, but suggest sizing down if you're not looking for an oversized look. It’s also non-stretch, so just bear that in mind when you make your size selection.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-cider-denim-pocket-wide-leg-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cider Denim Pocket Wide Leg Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cider Denim Pocket Wide Leg Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UwelcGHQmhDntae8C4i1uvEHQVM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cider--denim-pocket-wide-leg-jumpsuit-dd68421ff8f4464f852ddc128c57c0c9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cider&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The wide legs make them look very '90s.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Not everyone will love the contrasting straps on the lighter colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cole says this is, hands down, her favorite place to buy overalls because of the vast number of color and pattern options on the site "They also have [various leg shapes], which I love," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are a solid choice for a classic, no-frills overall (and they come in sizes from 0 to 26, which is one of the reasons they're a best seller). They come in four classic colors and have exceptionally wide legs to make them look very '90s — and very lengthening on the body. Reviewers write that if you want a roomy fit through the abdomen you should size up, but do be mindful that with the wide legs, you may need some tailoring if you do. You can also unbutton some of the side buttons for a roomier fit in your true size.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Size:</strong> 0–26</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pattern-plus-size-cider-boho-all-over-print-floral-pocket-jumpsuit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pattern (Plus-Size)</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cider Boho All Over Print Floral Pocket Jumpsuit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cider Boho All Over Print Floral Pocket Jumpsuit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lSz39jPkQzc-EPVc2QPdotwlTP4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cider--boho-all-over-print-floral-pocket-jumpsuit--1d2123c87e0c42c789c3fbc36bf2221b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cider&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> If you like patterns at all, these are incredibly cute.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The legs are very wide.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the brand’s more classic overall offerings, Cider also gives us some very cute overall patterns to work with. A pattern can be a lovely way to play up the whimsical vibes of a pair of overalls if the utilitarian style is just not for you. And these options are incredibly cute, and (thanks to the inclusive sizing and hint of spandex in the fabric) they're just as comfortable as its non-patterned offerings. The price is affordable, too, which allows you to experiment with these patterns (and tailor the bottoms, if you're shorter) without feeling like you're making a massive wardrobe commitment. If you like patterned summer dresses, try these as an alternative!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6 | <strong>Size:</strong> 0–26</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-plus-size-you--all-black-denim-overall></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black (Plus-Size)</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>You + All Black Denim Overall</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="You + All Black Denim Overall" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LRoEh8JQZhBylL3H_mUYJGLxqfg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/you---all-black-denim-overall--18f00f8b79ba4e03a23fdf30d49a18c5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>You + All&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The construction is classic, and the color is a rich, deep black.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It's still not the most size-inclusive brand on here, even though it has great extended sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cole likes the selection at You + All — particularly if you're looking for basics that work in a multifunctional way. The cost is reasonable, and the structure is meant to accommodate different body types effectively (which isn't a given). Because the style is non-stretch and all-cotton, make sure to wash them carefully so that they don't shrink or lose the deep black color. The distressed detailing is subtle, and the straight-leg silhouette means there's a tapered effect. So, if you're looking for your overalls to give you a sleek and lengthened look, this is a great pick.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> Black | <strong>Size:</strong> 16–22</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-corduroy-happy-sailed-women-corduroy-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Corduroy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Happy Sailed Women Corduroy Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Happy Sailed Women Corduroy Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nutc5H8xh4U6wSrCfOwD39SiTcE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Happy-Sailed--Women-Corduroy-Overalls-a76302a86b52480aa6bddd3ac082ff17.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The corduroy is both soft and durable without feeling stifling.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It's not going to be as long-lasting as more expensive options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As an alternative to denim, corduroy is deeply casual and soft, but also playful with its variety of color options.

Reviewers say, however, that this pair is the exception: The overalls are both comfortable and also have a bit of a stretch to them. One reviewer writes, "I can't take these off, they are so cute and comfy!" Note that they might be a bit cropped on a tall person.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 10 | <strong>Size:</strong> S–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-v-neck-free-people-high-roller-denim-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best V-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People High Roller Denim Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People High Roller Denim Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ce9G7VHluNeuZmzxUxNaKskH2L4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/free-people-high-roller-denim-overalls-f0ecc883be104be299abed303a19dc44.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This is potentially a good-fitting option for people who have larger chests.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> An all-cotton composition isn’t stretchy and thus may not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If the traditional bib neckline doesn't work for your chest or upper body, consider a V-neck. The deep v in front and back of this, plus the adjustable straps, mean that it’ll work for several body types and chest sizes. (It’s also a full ’70s throwback — no wonder it's a best seller!)&nbsp;We love that it comes in <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">purple corduroy and orange colors, too</a>.

These overalls have just a touch of stretch, which makes sense since they're designed to fit closer to the body. The light olive color will make the pair look sleek and tailored since denim might feel too constrictive when it's tight. If you're tall, this might be cropped at the ankle; it might require a little tailoring to make it fit you perfectly, but it's worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> 24–32</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-madewell-denim-oversized-carpenter-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oversized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Denim Carpenter Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Denim Oversized Carpenter Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yaY99vIMN2qidg7IK6tylZtnJ1o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-denim-oversized-carpenter-overalls-9eb188a6449c4c7fa019e3429b33da42.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> You can't get much comfier than this baggy pick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Because it's oversized, it might gap or fold in some places.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you like your overalls to feel gloriously oversized (meaning they don't pinch or squeeze no matter what you're doing in them), this is the perfect pair for you. Knee patches and a hem that you can cuff make this look workwear-adjacent, which works effectively with a more baggy style. The fabric is soft and medium weight — it's non-stretch, so if you want to lean into the oversized vibe, go up one size. Choosing a slightly larger size is also helpful if you're planning on layering underneath this with a bulkier sweater in the colder months. We love a multifunctional, multi-seasonal pick!&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-seraphine-black-denim-maternity-overalls></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Maternity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Seraphine Black Denim Maternity Overalls</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Seraphine Black Denim Maternity Overalls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1i1qYudMRJMiJsouLMpmf0DhIig=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/light-wash-denim-maternity-overalls-9395f8261c354280a511f167eb60d708.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Seraphine&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This is designed to help moms-to-be get dressed easily and feel great.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The price-per-wear will be higher since it can only be worn for several months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Numerous pregnant women or moms surveyed for this story love, love, love Seraphine's overalls (regardless of whether they're a dedicated maternity style). The openness around the chest and waist means that they can accommodate a growing belly in the first trimesters — but in the third, it's best to get a maternity style so you won't feel uncomfortable trying to squeeze into your old pairs. This is similarly slim through the leg, which may not be everyone's preference, but this pair is designed to stretch everywhere. (Wide legs in pregnancy can make you feel larger, not smaller). These will also be a must-have in the postpartum period, so you'll get more wear out of them than you might suppose.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> 2–14</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-racerback-lee-womens-bib-overall></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Racerback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lee Women's Bib Overall</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lee Women's Bib Overall" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/V1ZjNpnbis13WeeQQQsIxT3XHG0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lee--womens-bib-overall-eff4efc12d014254b262fae18670c253.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A racerback design up top means better support through the chest.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> This has a long inseam, so if you’re shorter, you may need to hem this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For some flair in the back of your overalls, consider the racerback. Not every iteration of this style is comfortable — the style is designed to support women's chests, and therefore, some people may find the design tight. However, this cotton-blend pair moves and stretches with you. It helps that it has an oversized, '90s- throwback design (thanks to a long inseam and wide legs) for a comfortable, roomy feel. A pair of overalls that feels kind of like pajamas?

The cut elongates the bottom half and works especially well for people with thinner hips or broad shoulders. Reviewers explain that this is the only pair of "trendy" overalls you'll ever need — meaning that flare styles are popular now but unique enough to look amazing for months and years (again, making it a nice pick for the price-per-wear value). Reviewers also write that they get tons of compliments — both tall and short people, which means it's a workable style for different heights — and that the flare is a nice feature to differentiate it from other overalls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What To Keep In Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"We recommend opting for a more tailored fit that accentuates your body shape without being overly tight," says Sockel. Na adds, "I’m in my early 40s, and generally, I try to avoid anything overly trendy. A pair that is oversized and super baggy could look a bit young on someone like me. Overalls are already a specific piece of clothing. Because of this, I would stick to a slim leg: a fit that is more classic, can be worn season after season, and gives you more styling choices."</p><p>All of this is not to say you can't go with a wide leg, simply that your overalls should be similar in cut, design, and fabric to the pieces of denim you really like — for those with thin hips or a longer waist, for example, a wider leg will help you feel balanced. Look for the little details that are already complementary to your natural style. Also, in general, pay attention to construction and read the reviews: some overalls work better for short or tall people (and it's hard to tailor the crotch on a pair of overalls).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It depends on what you're hoping to achieve with your look. If you want non-stretch denim that hugs your figure, that's great. In fact, Na prefers it: "A pair made with rigid denim is ideal. This will give it a more substantial look and feel. If the fabric is too flowy or flimsy, it can give a more whimsical look, which I typically try to avoid." Just know that you might want to size up or not layer much underneath it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">By contrast, for those who have never tried overalls before, Sockel does suggest fabric that has a built-in stretch. "Look for quality fabrics that provide comfort and durability, like denim blends or softer cottons." Adds Schneider, who specializes in plus-size fashion, "Select overalls made from feminine materials like corduroy, denim with a bit of stretch, or even a soft linen blend."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pockets</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overalls can be a deeply practical garment that people wear when they garden or do housework. Or, they could be a fashion statement that has everything to do with shape. If the latter, as Sockel explains, "It’s fun to play around with fashion-forward details like asymmetrical closures or unique embellishments." You don't need as many real pockets as when you're functionally using the overalls, in other words.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Distressing<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A pair of distressed overalls is perfectly fine — so long as the look is still polished instead of messy.

Originally, overalls were made for people who did physical labor (which, at the time, mostly meant men), and were known for the ease of movement and multifunctionality, thanks to lots of pockets. In the 1960s and beyond, though, the piece became a fashion garment that anyone could wear.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are some ways to style overalls?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Believe it or not, says Sockel, overalls are "much more versatile than people often think." Think about tops you would normally pair with jeans, and use those for your base layers, she adds. "For a laid-back, street style-inspired aesthetic, add a cropped hoodie as your base layer, with your overalls worn on top. If you’re looking to give your overalls a more polished look, pair them with a crisp white button-down [shirt] and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chunky loafer</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Na appreciates that overalls work well in summer (just layer it with a floral top underneath) and also in winter. "I love leaning into the high-low of overalls, [including] workwear and office wear. In the winter, and some may be surprised, knitwear under a pair of overalls works really well." Schneider recommends traditionally feminine accessories to complete your look. "Consider a skinny belt to define your waist, dainty jewelry, and a fashionable scarf or headband," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are ways to keep the look feeling modern instead of dated. Stick to ballet flats or a more structured shoe, and add contrast with a tight bodysuit or lace top. Cole explains that it's important to pick the right outerwear, too. "If wearing a jacket or sweater over, opting for a cropped look or a duster is my favorite pairing," she says. "I feel like the cropped jacket draws attention to the waistline and adds an element that breaks the look of overalls up. The duster adds a bit of dramatic flair."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should overalls look and feel?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Comfort is key: Even when you're making a stylish statement with your pair of overalls, you still want to be able to stand, sit, eat, and move around. "We suggest opting for silhouettes that are tailored without feeling too restrictive. Unlike most jumpsuits, most overalls feature adjustable straps, which helps cater the fit to what feels most comfortable for you," says Sockel.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Full-time freelance writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katherine J.
