Two-thirds of this investment will be needed in the high-growth emerging markets. The robust economic growth of key markets, such as Asia, is creating a myriad of opportunities for investors - but these markets also come with challenges that should be managed carefully.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Access to capital is just one of the hurdles that early-stage energy infrastructure companies must overcome. Even more challenging is how to manage the fast pace of expansion as these new companies become major growth platforms that harness the benefits of scale and accumulated experience," says Paul Hanrahan, CEO of American Capital Energy & Infrastructure (ACEI). "The key to being successful is finding the right funding partner that offers not only the capital itself, but also the industry experience necessary to build these types of platforms in emerging markets."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Located just outside Washington D.C., Annapolis-based ACEI specialises and invests in energy and infrastructure assets, such as power generation plants and related energy assets. It also invests in the associated fuel production and transport businesses, including utility distribution and transmission systems. ACEI has a strong worldwide network by being part of publicly traded private equity firm and global asset manager American Capital, which has US$83 billion under management.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Many developing countries struggle to meet their need for electricity, which supports growing industries and improves the quality of their residents' lives," Hanrahan says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having served as the CEO of the AES Corporation, one of the largest global power companies, Hanrahan knows what he is talking about. He and co-founder Richard Santoroski have successfully created similar platforms in the past in Asia, Latin and North America, Africa and the Middle East. "Having worked across more than 40 countries in the energy space, we understand that the challenges vary from one place to another - and we are ready to use our knowledge, experience and resources to bridge the gaps."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are an innovative company led by a veteran team with an established track record of successfully investing in energy infrastructure assets across the energy value chain during multiple stages of development," says Santoroski, managing director of ACEI and former AES executive</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">vice-president. "Our strategy is to focus on strong teams with a few operating or development assets that can develop into significant growth platforms within their markets. We help them build with capital and expertise, going from one or two assets to a multi-asset generation platform, which is essential in emerging markets such as Africa, Asia and Latin America."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hanrahan and Santoroski are behind ACEI's rapid rise in recognition and credibility, bringing years of experience at AES, which flourished from being a small independent power producer to a US$17 billion Fortune 150 global power giant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their recent investment in one of the new power companies in Nigeria exemplifies ACEI's successful execution of their strategy, where their investment in the power generation company is growing from developing an US$800-million plant to becoming a major power generation platform in the region. ACEI also targets similar investments in Latin America and Asia, which it manages from its offices in Singapore, Johannesburg and Annapolis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">ACEI generally seeks investments between US$50 million and US$200 million, however, it also pursues opportunities that may require bigger investments, including acquisitions, corporate divestitures, ownership transitions and going-private transactions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"In the Asian region, we see China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and India as big growth areas," Hanrahan says. "Whether it is partnering with existing management teams that need capital, joint venture partners or somebody who wants to sell equipment, we are interested to invest - and present exciting opportunities for those who want to partner with us."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdha35zfZhqZpqblZ56prnPqK6eqqNisq%2Bx0aCwZqGem7%2Biv9OrrJyspaeybq%2FOpqeappmawG65wLGgpqGjmnqxu9Oepa2hkaE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniel-radcliffe-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Potter Salary vs. Emma, Rupert</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wiki-networth-age-full-bio-relationship-and-more-17.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wiki, Networth, Age, Full Bio, Relationship And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
