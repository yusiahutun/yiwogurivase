"We were very young women constantly put into compromised situations where we had to blood sport it out against each other to get through a day of production."</p><p>Bosworth, who has transitioned from the small screen to the wellness space said, she was "not as good on reality TV" because she wasn't as inclined to get into the drama as some of her co-stars.</p><p>"I served a very specific role, which I'm actually grateful for in hindsight. I didn't have to get into it too much," she shared. "But in the areas where I did, it still kind of haunts me to this day because there's so many stories behind this story everybody saw on television that run very counter to what the public thinks of you."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e859c54a-2c42-4188-b96a-dc018b84d7ad data-container-ref=toofab:article:044b7c1a-bc45-4400-aed0-1d4b2bf6e8e4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/21/5by4/2022/11/08/219b296d6bc34f6eac515d2816fb4ba7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lauren Conrad, Kristin Cavallari & Stephen Colletti Reunite and Finally Hash Out All Their Laguna Beach Drama</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As for why friend and co-star, <a href=#><strong>Lauren Conrad</strong></a> has chosen to step out of the spotlight after exiting the reality TV show, Bosworth said that Conrad's level of fame became overwhelming.</p><p>"I think that they were famous to a degree that whenever anything happened that was negative, the blowback felt so significant and so life changing that you really live with that trauma and it affects you on a go-forward basis in terms of how much you're inclined to share with people," Bosworth explained of Conrad, who has previously called reality TV "triggering."</p><p>While The Hills may not be a space Bosworth wants to revisit, there have been rumblings that she and her <a href=#><strong>Laguna Beach</strong></a> co-stars may reunite for a 20th anniversary special.</p><p>"I sort of talked to a couple people about it because we graduated from high school in 2004. It's 2024.
