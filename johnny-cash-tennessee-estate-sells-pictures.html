The <a href=#>Hendersonville Standard</a> reported in 2020 that Nashville hedge fund manager Cristan Blackman and his wife, Tina Blackman, bought the land from Lakehouse Holdings, a limited liability company owned by Texas businessman James Gresham.</p><p>“It’s such a majestic piece of property,” Cristan Blackman said at the time. “My wife and I are honored to own it.”</p><p>Johnny and June Carter Cash resided for more than three decades in a 14,000-square-foot home on the property that hosted a number of celebrities and dignitaries over the years, including Bob Dylan, Al Gore and Billy Graham. According to <a href=#>RolandNote.com</a>, Cash purchased the land on Oct. 10, 1966, and built the mansion where the couple lived from 1968 until their deaths in 2003.</p><p>Bee Gees singer Barry Gibb purchased the estate in 2005, and the main house burned to the ground during renovations in 2007. The property has changed hands several times since.</p><p>The Blackmans announced plans to build a new home on the property and reside there. Cristan Blackman — who recalled riding in his grandfather's boat as a child and looking up at the Cash estate in wonder&nbsp;— said he wouldn't do anything to dishonor the legacy of the estate, which was designated with a marker from the Tennessee Historical Commission in 2019.</p><p>“I respect the property and I respect the community,” he states.</p><p>The former Cash estate features more than 1,000 feet of lake frontage and lush, spectacular views in every direction. A stone wall surrounds the entirety of the gated property, and there are beautiful rock walls and terraced steps all over the land.</p><p>A swimming pool, tennis court and covered boat dock are among the entities that survived the fire in 2007 and are still intact today, as well as&nbsp;a one-bedroom apartment building that June Carter Cash once used as a place to store her costumes.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to view the legendary estate.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: See More Country Singers' Homes</a><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Johnny Cash's Iconic $3.2 Million Lakefront Estate in Nashville</h2>The iconic lakefront estate that once belonged to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Cash</a>&nbsp;and June Carter Cash sold for $3.2 million, and as pictures show, the property is stunning.<h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: Look Inside George Strait's Spectacular Mansion</h2><p>George Strait is selling his one-of-a-kind mansion in Texas, and he's actually reduced his price considerably. The country legend is asking $6.9 million for his 7,925-square-foot home that includes three bedrooms, four full bathrooms and two half-baths on a hilltop in a very exclusive area of San Antonio.</p><p>The house sits on 12.2 acres and includes a gourmet kitchen, separate his and her bathrooms and closets and 14 hand-sculpted masonry fireplaces. The main house is wired for surround sound throughout, and it also features outdoor living spaces including a patio with built-in grill, sink, icemaker and refrigerator. There's also an infinity pool/spa and a sports court, a workout room with a private bathroom and sauna, and a walk-in safe room.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Alan Jackson's Spectacular Hilltop Estate</h2><p>After selling their spectacular Southern manor home in 2010, Alan Jackson and his wife moved to to what might be an even more impressive mansion, if that's even possible. Their 5-bedroom, 8-bathroom, 22,012-square-foot estate in the same Nashville suburb of Franklin features bedrooms that are all well-appointed suites, while the formal dining and living areas are finished off with splendid arched doorways, oversized windows and elaborate woodwork. The residence also includes a bar, a media room and multiple indoor and outdoor fireplaces. It sold for $19 million in March of 2021.</p><p><strong>See Pictures of Johnny Cash's Lavish Lakefront Estate:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo6eYo7u6ecKaqqFlpJq7r7HSrJyeZZWowaLAxGaqnqScqHqxtcKtrKudo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-impact-of-technology-on-sexual-behavior.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Impact of Technology on Sexual Behavior</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lidl-shoppers-love-wooden-garden-accessories-planters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lidl's chic wooden garden accessories are a Spring must-have just ask shoppers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
