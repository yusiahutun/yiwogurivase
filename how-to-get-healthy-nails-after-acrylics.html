Then, an acrylic nail is placed on top. Eventually, the nails will have to be removed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two ways to remove acrylics, and Ling Lin suggested that "there is an extremely high chance that either of these removal processes can and will damage your nail bed." First, you can soak nails in an acetone-based solution — which can weaken them by drying them out. You can also remove acrylics via e-file — which can weaken nails by removing too many layers.</p><p>There is an extremely high chance that either of these removal processes can and will damage your nail bed. — Amy Ling Lin</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You're not guaranteed to see damage after a set of acrylics — there are many different factors at play — but it can happen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The condition of the natural nail after acrylic nail removal varies greatly depending on the skill level of the technician who's applied it, as well as the quality of the product used," noted celeb stylist Fleury Rose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If a nail technician doesn't know what they're doing, they may file your nails improperly, creating thin and brittle nail beds, said celebrity nail artist Candice Idehen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Usually, your nails hurt to the touch and are visibly damaged," Idehen explained. "They may be extremely thin and flexible. Another sign is if they begin to break easily or tear."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chipping, flaking, and indentations or grooves are also results of improper nail technique. Another source of nail damage may come from the salon's products.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Idehen said there is one substance that is banned in the U.S. because of the damage it causes, but some salons still use it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"MMA Methyl Methacrylate causes damage to the natural nail because of its prep and adhesion process," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Idehen encouraged those getting acrylics to do their research, find reputable salons, and splurge on better services.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Damage can also be a result of peeling off your acrylics, which Idehen strongly urged you to resist doing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you peel off acrylic or any other enhancement, for that matter, you take off several layers of your natural nail with it," said the nail pro.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your nails fall into any of the categories above, don't panic. Our nails can be nursed back to health pretty easily.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-repair-damage-from-acrylic-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Repair Damage from Acrylic Nails</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>At-Home Treatments</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You don't need to break the bank receiving&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>treatments</a>&nbsp;to get your nails healthy again, and one solution may already be in your kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Using olive oil works wonders in restoring hydration to the nail," said Idehen, adding that you can also purchase a drugstore treatment, like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>OPI's nail strengthener</a>, Nail Envy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Idehen recommended applying it every first, third, fifth, and seventh day of the week. At the end of the week, she said to remove and start the process again.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Professional Treatments</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When your nail is too far gone for any at-home hacks, Idehen recommended receiving a professional treatment like the IBX Nail Strengthening System.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's like a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Keratin treatment</a>&nbsp;for your nails," Idehen said. "It uses protein and hydrating oils to fill in all the areas of damage on your nail, resulting in a much healthier nail even after one service!"</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wait It Out</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All our pros agreed that your nails could be nursed back to health, without a doubt, but it'll take time. Your damaged nail needs to grow out completely so that it can be replaced with a healthy nail. While you wait, stick to regular nail polish, get regimented about moisturizing, and stay away from acrylics. When in doubt, go see a pro for their advice.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-future-damage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Future Damage</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Waiting it out before receiving your next acrylic set may be a bummer, but there is hope. Idehen said you don't have to give up acrylics for good. It's all about finding the right salon with experts who will take care of your nails. You also have to resist the urge to pick and peel them off yourself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Usually, these types of salons are going to charge a premium or may be ran by an independent nail tech who has opted out of the traditional salon setting so that she can spend the extra time caring for the natural nail while providing services," said Idehen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While this may cost you a bit more money, it's so worth it if it means&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keeping your nails from being damaged</a>. She also suggested finding a salon that uses&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Apres Gel-X</a>, a soft gel extension system.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It will give you a similar look and feel with more versatility," said Idehen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqyfqHypu9Zmq6hll5rBbrTEmqOtoKliu6K1y6xkmp6kmr9urcKrsKWhk6g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leonardo-dicaprio-beard-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leonardo DiCaprio Beard Photo - The Hollywood Gossip</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./guillermo-maldonado.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Guillermo Maldonado</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
