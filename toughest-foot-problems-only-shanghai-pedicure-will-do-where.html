Blades are also used to trim the toenails and to remove any warts or verrucas. Then, dead skin on the feet is buffed away, before a nail tonic is applied.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam Kwun-ching, known to his clients as Uncle Ball, is one of the best Shanghainese pedicurists in town. Now 72, he grew up in Hong Kong, where he has been helping his clients since the early 1960s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/c9366b52-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_1320x770_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When a customer walks in, Lam will invite them to submerge their feet in a tub of warm water. Not only is this for their comfort, it is also necessary to soften the skin and the cuticles. After they have soaked for about 15 minutes, Lam carefully dries their feet and places them on a small stool. What follows is all down to the master’s skills – and the precision of his sharp blade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/b9a3a33a-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_1320x770_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ms Sin, 45, is one of Lam’s most loyal customers. “I have been visiting Uncle Ball for more than five years now,” says Sin, letting out a little sigh as Lam extracts a final piece of ingrown toenail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sin says her foot problems led her to visit many different doctors and health professionals; these asked her to take antibiotics to get rid of inflammation or even sent her to an operating theatre for surgical procedures. However, her stubborn ingrown toenail always came back.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong’s old-school barbershops captured on camera by Dutch photographer before they die out</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam became her alternative foot doctor. Now, all it takes is 30 minutes a month at his workshop and Sin can walk pain-free.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I genuinely don’t know what I would do if Uncle Ball was gone,” says Sin, as she puts on her shoes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shanghai pedicures are not just about treating pain and medical issues, however. In fact, says Lam, it can be an incredibly enjoyable experience. Some of his customers have no specific problems, but come in because they love the feeling of getting their feet treated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/a948fc9c-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_1320x770_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Shanghai pedicure is thought to have originated in Yangzhou, a city in present-day Jiangsu province in eastern China where public bathhouses with pedicurists were a place for communal relaxation in the Ming and Qing dynasties.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">[Bruce Lee] was a wonderful man – very eloquent and nice. When he died, I was very upset.Lam Kwun-ching</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nearby Shanghai soon adopted the bathhouses and co-opted the Yangzhou pedicure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Inscribed as part of China’s intangible cultural heritage, the treatment is also known as “Yangzhou three knives”, referring to three ways of holding the pedicure blades.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other than physically removing warts and toenails, the buffing of the skin is equally important. Pedicurists use foot buffers and towels to massage the customer’s feet. It is believed this massage triggers acupuncture points and relieves pain all over the body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/b1671b3e-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_1320x770_121202.JPG>When people from Shanghai and Yangzhou fled to Hong Kong after the communists took power in China, they brought their bathhouse culture and their traditional pedicures with them.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bathhouses and their complimentary services were popular in Hong Kong from the 1950s until the 1980s. Similar to a massive sauna or a Roman bath, they would be filled with naked men, professional masseurs scrubbing their backs. In the next room, there would be Shanghai pedicurists working their way through their tired feet. Celebrities, businessmen and high-level politicians would gather in them to relax.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/37c281fc-1b96-11e8-804d-87987865af94_1320x770_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam learned his craft from a Yangzhou pedicurist. He shows me a bull’s horn and some donkey leather that were his training tools. Their textures resemble those of human toenails and skin.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong’s tiny understairs shops: the Elgin Street tailor who treasures his craft and a sense of community</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being a protégé was a long process,” says Lam. “You needed to train for five years before you could start working on clients.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam remembers one particular client – Hong Kong action film legend Bruce Lee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/e552c13c-1b97-11e8-804d-87987865af94_1320x770_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was a wonderful man – very eloquent and nice. When he died, I was very upset,” says Lam. He says the actor suffered from a serious case of ingrown toenails and had to come to the pedicurist to deal with the pain.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I genuinely don’t know what I would do if Uncle Ball was goneMs Sin, one of Lam’s most loyal customers</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Bruce Lee also just liked a good chat,” Lam adds. Being a good conversationalist is part of Lam’s recipe for being a good pedicurist. Many of his customers come back because they just want some company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another Shanghai pedicurist in Hong Kong is Master Zhang, a native of Yangzhou now in his 60s. He has been working at reflexology spa chain Happy Foot in Wan Chai for six years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang was a sculptor, but could not earn enough to sustain a living. He left Yangzhou for Hong Kong in 1988 in search of a better life. Thankfully, he already had a head start at sharpening knives – an essential skill for a Shanghai pedicurist to have.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He trained with one of his neighbours and soon went to work in one of the bathhouses in Hong Kong. He is now the top Shanghai pedicurist in the establishment he works in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/d67e0c02-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_972x_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Lam and Zhang, Hong Kong native Alan Ng Song-nang learned the ropes working in one of the city’s bathhouses at a time when they were just for men.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No women were allowed into these bathhouses. There were rules till the noughties that male practitioners were not supposed to touch women’s feet,” says Ng, who is also in his 60s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/eb76031c-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_1320x770_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When these bathhouses disappeared from Hong Kong neighbourhoods in the noughties due to urban redevelopment, many Shanghai pedicurists had to find other ways to make a living. Ng found a tiny shop space in Jordan’s Bowring Centre, just big enough for a chair for himself and one customer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/c119330a-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_972x_121202.JPG>Today he works five days a week but spends most of his hours away from the shop, doing house calls for his loyal customers who have become too old to go there.<h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">How to heal cracked heels in Hong Kong</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Doing house calls is a way for Ng to connect with his past, but Lam has not been able to do that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two years ago, he had a near fatal heart attack, which put him in hospital for several months. It was during this time he saw how much his customers loved him, he says. One customer called him every day, and brought him drinks when he returned to his workshop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the heart attack behind him, Lam is still working five days a week. His daughter, Ms Lam, has become his guardian. She converted part of her small Japanese accessories shop in Jordan into a workshop for him. Separated by a curtain, Ms Lam manages her business while watching over her father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/02/28/e21c230a-1ab6-11e8-804d-87987865af94_972x_121202.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Shanghai pedicure is his passion,” she says. “I will never take up his job, because it is not as easy as it looks.
