During the parliamentary elections in 2021, he was chosen to serve in the Ukrainian parliament.</li><li>He was honored in 1999 for being the first super heavyweight world champion to score 26 knockout victories.</li><li>Klitschko graduated from Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyi State University with a degree in physical <a href=#>education</a>. He also received a master’s degree in social development management from the Ukrainian National Academy of Public Administration in 2011.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vitali Volodymyrovych Klitschko was <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_Klitschko data-lasso-id=123237 data-wpel-link=external data-cke-saved->born July 19, 1971</a>, in Belovodskoye, Kirghiz SSR, Soviet Union which is now known as Kyrgyzstan.</p><p>Vitali was raised by his father, a Soviet Air Force major <a href=#>general</a> and military attaché in East Germany. A short time after the Chornobyl nuclear tragedy, his father, who was one of the commanders assigned with the cleanup, received a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Klitschko worked as a toolmaker at the Kyiv Automation Plant as a young man to help pay the expenses. Years later, he was alleged to have worked as a debt collector for a mafia lord in the 1990s, an accusation that Vitali has strongly rejected.</p><p>Vitali’s brother Wladimir Klitschko is also a heavyweight boxer and has managed to dominate the sport with his brother.</p><p>Because of the nature of their father’s work, they had to relocate regularly to other nations and Soviet republics. He ended up attending multiple schools as a result and served in the military in Uman, a Soviet Air Force base, from 1989 until 1991.</p><p>Klitschko began boxing in the 1980s, and Anatoliy Klimanov, a former Soviet fighter, served as his primary <a href=#>trainer</a>.</p><p>However, when the Soviet Union decided to no longer outlaw the sport, Vitali soon picked up kickboxing.</p><p>He competed and trained in kickboxing, karate, and boxing throughout these formative years, displaying potential in all three <a href=#>sports</a>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After winning his first 24 fights via knockout or technical knockout, Vitali earned a reputation as a terrifying opponent, not unlike Mike Tyson in his prime.</p><p>He defeated Herbie Hide in the second round of their fight to claim the WBO heavyweight championship in 1999.</p><p>He then made two title defenses but fell to Chris Byrd in 2000, primarily due to Vitali’s severe shoulder injury, which resulted in a stoppage.</p><p>Klitschko was in the lead when the fight was stopped, according to the scorecards, and he then faced harsh criticism for ending the fight.</p><p>After 5 straight victories, Klitschko proved that he deserved a chance to challenge Lennox Lewis for the WBC championship.</p><p>Despite being the underdog, Vitali startled Lewis with a series of powerful blows, but Klitschko received a cut over his left eye, causing the referee to once more stop the fight due to an injury.</p><p>When the fight was called off, Klitschko once more had the advantage on the scorecards but failed to secure a victory.</p><p>Willing to fight Lewis again, Vitali put in a valiant effort to do so, but Lewis relinquished the championship when he retired in 2004.</p><p>Ultimately, Klitschko went on to defeat the South African heavyweight champion, Corrie Sanders, to claim the WBC championship and prove he was the best.</p><p>After a successful medical procedure to fix his ACL ligament, Klitschko made a comeback in 2008 to challenge Samuel Peter for the heavyweight championship.</p><p>After that, he successfully defended his championship against a variety of opponents up until 2013, when he decided to quit and concentrate on his political career.</p><p>Klitschko joins Larry Holmes, Tyson Fury, George Foreman, and Frank Bruno as one of the world’s most devasting heavyweight champions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=vitali-klitschko%e2%80%99s-career-earnings></span>Vitali Klitschko’s
