BTS’ rapper and producer, Min Yoongi, known as Suga, has announced his plans to join the military. After his momentous D-Day World Tour, BigHit Entertainment announced through the fan community site <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://weverse.io/bts/notice/14749?hl=en">Weverse </a>that Suga has ended his enlistment postponement.</p><p>“We would like to inform our fans that SUGA has initiated the military enlistment process by applying for the termination of his enlistment postponement,” BigHit said in a statement.</p><p>“We ask you for your continued love and support for SUGA until he completes his military service and safely returns,” the statement concluded. “Our company will spare no effort in providing support for our artist.”</p><p>Suga is the second oldest of the group and turned 30 in 2023, which is his last year to enlist. On February 14, 2023, BigHit Entertainment announced that Suga would be embarking on a world tour under his stage name and his alter ego Agust D as well as a new album titled D-Day. He released two solo mixtapes under Agust D: Agust D, released in 2016, and D-2, released in 2020.</p><p>After his last concert, Suga went on to Weverse Live to assure fans and thank them for their support. He also showed off his ‘7’ friendship tattoo. “I think I had a fun tour the last couple of months. I really don’t cry,” he said. “Those past 10 years went by like a film. I started crying from then.”</p><p>He concluded his live stream hinting at enlistment, but not directly mentioning it. “I think it’s a lie if I say ‘soon,’” he told viewers about seeing them again. “Let’s see each other in 2025, OK? Please wait a little bit,” he concluded in his message to ARMY. “2025. See you then!”</p><p>BigHit Entertainment posted on Weverse that Suga will start his service on September 22, 2023. “SUGA will be beginning his required service on September 22,” the statement read. “There will not be any official events taking place on the day he starts his service or on the day he enters the training camp. We kindly ask fans to refrain from visiting SUGA at his workplace during the period of his service. Please convey your warm regards and encouragement in your hearts only.”</p><p>The statement continued, “Furthermore, please be mindful to avoid getting adversely affected by unauthorized tours or package products that illegally use the artist’s intellectual property. Our company will take appropriate measures against attempts at any commercial activity that make unauthorized use of artist IP. We ask for your continued love and support for SUGA until he completes his service and returns. Our company will also strive to provide all the support he needs during this time.</p><p>Suga posted on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://weverse.io/bts/artist/1-126696586>Weverse</a> on the day of his enlistment while giving his thanks and support to ARMY. “I’ll faithfully serve and come back … Please stay healthy and let’s meet all again in 2025.”</p><p>Because of a shoulder surgery in 2020, Suga will serve as a social service agent, per <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-bts-suga-military-service-8a0318e3008747139bb8d8903dee348d rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Associated Press.</a> The job is a&nbsp;kind of compulsory employment set up as an alternative to military conscription, especially for those with physical or mental health issues (though they still have to complete three weeks of basic military training at some point).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfl8G0ecyio6KskafGbr%2FEq62im5Vk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cheryl-hair-transformation-bob-london-charity-gala.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cheryl shocks with four dramatic hair transformations - and one was a bob</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anne-hathaway-sparks-reaction-unexpected-bikini-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anne Hathaway sparks reaction in unexpected bikini top</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
