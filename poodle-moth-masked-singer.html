I ended up gaining weight sitting behind a desk and being depressed. All people do is send you Sprinkles cupcakes, which is lovely but not when you’re depressed and want to be an actress. But I thought if I can’t do it for myself in my time, I can help other actors facilitate their dreams.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9211563731932><h2><strong>“In my life, I was raised to know one thing: Sometimes, the ones you love most leave without so much as a letter.
