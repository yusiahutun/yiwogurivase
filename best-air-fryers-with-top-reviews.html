The result will seem fresher than it would be in a microwave, which often leaves reheated food unevenly cooked, overcooked or soggy.</p><h2><strong>What are the best air fryer brands?</strong></h2><p id=eee-M2_X9Ab6 data-wc=91>Ninja air fryers are considered top-of-the-line, and are pretty much the highest-rated everywhere, so if you can find one on sale, grab it while you can for less!

How perfect is this air fryer? My favourite thing is that you needn't worry about timings: all you have to do is sync the drawers, so everything finishes at the same time. What's more, it cooks 40% faster than an oven (no need to preheat it) and it uses up to 70% less energy. So, you can get dinner ready quicker whilst slashing your bills. Another highlight? There's Extra Crisp technology which makes it great for bacon and french fries. You can also grill steaks like a pro on the Sizzling Grill Plate, which thankfully is dishwasher safe." - Leanne Bayley, Director of Lifestyle & Commerce.</p><p dir=ltr>Yes, you could opt for an air fryer with one single drawer if you're a chef cooking for one, but it might be restrictive. This one from Tefal is the best of both worlds as you can enjoy single and dual zone cooking in one sleek grey appliance with Easy Fry Dual, Tefal’s dual air fryer and grill. And even better? It's Jamie Oliver approved – you may have spotted it on the celebrity chef's show, Jamie’s Air-Fryer Meals</p><p dir=ltr>Unlike most double air fryers, Easy Fry Dual has two different sized drawers – a 5.2L and a 3.1L – that you can use independently to meet your cooking needs. If you're dining alone? Just heat the smaller drawer to save energy. Or use both to make a complete meal. The XL drawer fits a whole chicken and the combined 8.3L capacity can feed up to 8.</p><p class=AffiliateArticleIndex_an3tpj5><span class=AffiliateArticleIndexCurrent_a1trfdnq>4</span><span class=AffiliateArticleIndexTotal_a1y7kdtj>/9</span></p>Ninja Foodi Dual Zone Air Fryer- AF300UK<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0ecb41bb247e-best-air-fryers-ninja-dual.png><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p><strong>Key information</strong></p><ul><li dir=ltr>Product Weight: 8.2kg</li><li dir=ltr>Product Dimensions (cm): H:31.5 x W:38 x D:26.5 cm</li><li dir=ltr>Wattage: 1 cooking drawer: 1200W | 2 cooking drawers: 2400W</li><li dir=ltr>Dish Washer Safe Components: Yes</li><li dir=ltr>Capacity: 7.6L</li><li dir=ltr>Guarantee: 2 Years</li></ul><p><strong>What we think</strong></p><p>This viral Ninja is a huge hit with HELLO!
