They also carried the largest touring video show complete with 1.5 million LED lights that showed graphics on video screens and on the floors of the stage. During the show, the stage also sprang props of flowers, grass, trees and even a windmill.

Joan Osborne, Michelle Branch and Jann Arden each took a turn as the opening act.</p><p>Representatives from “Rock The Vote” were at each of the performances encouraging fans to register and vote, regardless of their political views.

The campaign features the Dixie Chicks as spokespersons and includes public service announcements, a soon to be launched forum on the "Rock the Vote" website designed to encourage young people to speak out and learn about all sides of the issues, and other activities to promote voter participation, particularly targeting young women.</p><p>Dixie Chicks will take a few weeks off before resuming the overseas leg of the “Top of the World Tour.” The tour will make stops in Europe and Australia throughout September and October.

The power outage occurred at 4 pm.</p><p>“We talked to her manager and her road crew, and their plan was to wait right up until 8 o’clock in case we got power back,” said Sam Madonia, director of the resort’s Entertainment Department. “When that didn’t happen, Jo Dee Messina said she wanted to perform anyway because all these people had come to see her.”</p><p>The original idea was for Messina to perform an acoustic concert on the Showroom stage. But the resort’s generators do not provide emergency lighting for the Showroom, creating safety concerns, so the audience was moved into the lobby and a piano was wheeled out.</p><p>“Her whole band came out,” Madonia said. “They had acoustic guitars, and the drummer had some maracas, and Jo Dee played the piano. They performed for about half an hour in the heat, and the crowd was great. They really appreciated the effort she made to make up for the inconvenience.”</p><p>During her half-hour performance, Messina fielded questions from a crowd of about 350 people.</p><p>“I’ve been doing this for 25 years, and this was a first,” Madonia said. “Everybody – the Showroom staff, her crew, the box office staff, security – everybody pitched in and worked together to bring this off.
