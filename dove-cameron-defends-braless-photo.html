"Women HAVE a history that has been systematically suppressed. Our collective spirituality has largely been tainted to fit the needs of men and those in power," she wrote. "Our girls deserve better. The time to introduce feminism and woman-centered spirituality to ALL children is now."</p><p>In a second post, she quoted another feminist author, Elizabeth Eiler, writing, "However you inhabit and express being Woman, embrace yourself in that way today!"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The two posts racked up an impressive 8.1 million likes combined, with comments ranging from high praise to disappointment in the Disney star.</p><p>"This is being a role model," she replied to one critic who appeared to delete their initial criticism, "this is exactly being a role model."</p><p>When another follower said they didn't understand how the photo was "empowering or inspiring" -- adding that it's "really not that [deep]" -- Cameron agreed, it shouldn't be, but unfortunately still is.</p><p>"I agree with you in the sense that it is not that deep. or groundbreaking whatsoever. or anything really to talk about. but it's only a big deal because this society is so beyond backwards that they have demonized basic anatomy and are very! up! in arms! about female bodily freedom," she responded.</p><p>"They're confused and loud about it. so, technically, it's not a big deal, and it shouldn't be, and the idea behind posting something like this is to normalize it. because a lot of girls feel confused about their bodies and what it means to be a woman (in a surface way, on this specific subject, about sexuality and men and who their body belongs to bc of long-lasting systemic repression)," the 23-year-old star continued.</p><p>"So. it's cool to be like, it's whatever. embrace yourself. don't hide, if you wanna, and wear a bra, if you wanna," she concluded, "but don't hide to avoid the backlash. because you don't deserve to have assholes giving you shit about YOUR BODY."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:eade5ee7-59db-5a0f-a141-d0563b17c14b data-container-ref=toofab:article:847360c2-e289-5563-85d0-d79939d37f5e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/77/5by4/2019/08/01/771cbdc495615142835dd4ffb166f67b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dove Cameron, Booboo Stewart and Kenny Ortega Reflect on Cameron Boyce's Legacy</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Cameron also posted a lengthy reply to a fan who said they too were feeling empowered "w no bra on right now" because of her post.</p><p>"Take ur f--kin bra off if you want. don't hide your natural body. people are weird. just because it's 'the norm' now to be ashamed of nipples or your female anatomy or your period doesn't mean they are actually bad or embarrassing???" wrote Cameron.</p><p>"Women's bodies are the literal coolest. anyone who tells you who to hide it or slut shames you or puts you down because of your gender can f--k RIGHT off," she continued. "And i would say we should sit and explain it to them, but really. who has the time. enjoy your life and empower others. bye!"</p><p>She went on to share messages from other fans showing her support in her Stories -- and even won support from "Riverdale" star Lili Reinhart, who shared a post her mom wrote about all the online chatter saying "Mass shootings are horrible. These are just boobs."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:43ab6c86-33c7-5d1f-95f2-29595b8af5d2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:847360c2-e289-5563-85d0-d79939d37f5e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/10/5by4/2019/07/31/101ba00a714f525c9e52883e66a963f7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">The Disney Channel</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dove Cameron and Boo Boo Stewart 'Sobbed Without Speaking' Following Cameron Boyce's Death</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j3Fmam1fmby3sYycmKadoqS7brDEn5ynnKNir7Oty56qrGWgnby1u44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./episode-113-metallica-hqs-marc-reiter-psyko-steves-stephen-chilton.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Episode 113: Metallica HQs Marc Reiter, Psyko Steves Stephen Chilton</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ava-phillippe-bob-hairstyle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ava Phillippe's new bob hairstyle looks like mum Reese Witherspoon's 90s hair</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beislers-new-duties-2.html>Beisler's New Duties</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./police-suspects-dumped-body-after-fatal-shooting-in-2021.html>Clinton man sentenced for dumping body after fatal shooting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jason-aldean-wife-brittany-birthday-picture.html>Jason Aldean Celebrates Wife Brittany On Her 33rd Birthday</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./crazy-vegas-mansion-elvis-stayed-gingers-rogers-danced-michael-jackson-moonwalked-comes-sale-html.html>Las Vegas mansion where Elvis and Michael Jackson stayed on sale for $3.5m</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-red-sun-wildfires-canada-html.html>The sinister reason the sun has been red in the US this past week</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog.
