More than 32,000 of the QR code wristbands had been given out, Lam said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the electronic wristbands would be fitted at the airport, and the authorities would also help travellers to install the mobile app upon arrival. “As the number of arrivals at the airport has decreased in the past two days, we now have the ability to do the installation there.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong reported an additional 24 cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, mostly imported, taking the city’s tally to 410. The government banned all foreigners from entering the city starting on Tuesday midnight while the quarantine measures would be extended to all other arrivals, including those from Taiwan and Macau.</p>Lam said arrivals at the airport from areas other than the US and Europe would still be given the old wristbands, while those crossing the border at Shenzhen Bay or the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong-Macau-Zhuhai Bridge</span></a> would be asked to turn on location-sharing services on chat platforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As many mainland Chinese use Android mobile phones without the Google Play store, it is difficult to install the tracking app, so the location-sharing method is more practical,” Lam said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/03/26/b7ed493e-6e9b-11ea-b0ed-5e14cf8eb9e1_1320x770_063758.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, people issued with the earlier wristbands had complained about not being able to activate the mobile app, which would start the tracking process, up to seven days after their arrival.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among them was retired Briton John Hill, 74, who had not been able to activate the tracker since he arrived from Indonesia last Thursday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said he was given the tracking bracelet and a booklet, but was not told that he needed to activate the device, which he only found out after reading the Post. “They didn’t have a clue what they were doing at the airport,” Hill said. “They were the blind leading the blind.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Currently in quarantine at a hotel in Sai Ying Pun, he had since made three follow-up calls, with no luck. “[The tracking bracelet] is not intrusive but it doesn’t work.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hill also complained that he was not informed about what he should do once the 14 days were up, such as whether he was required to go to a clinic for a check-up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another returnee, Yeung, had also been unable to receive the activation code for the tracker since his return from Europe last Friday. Out of his family of three, only his wife managed to receive the activation code successfully, he said on RTHK’s morning radio talk show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I called the hotline 24 times, and only managed to get through once. Then they called me to follow up twice, but they still have not fixed the problem,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/03/26/4f7128c6-6ea5-11ea-b0ed-5e14cf8eb9e1_1320x770_063758.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, a second resident, Yau, said while he was able to receive the activation code, he was given an error message which said “user already exists” when he tried to input the code.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the complaints, Lam insisted that the “great majority” of the wristbands had already been activated, and the OGCIO was sending out text messages every night to those who had not yet done so since Monday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course some of them encountered some problems, the most common is they have not provided the correct phone number which can receive SMSs from us,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lam added that 3,000 people had already activated the wristbands upon receiving the text message reminders on Tuesday night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The OGCIO had set up two new hotlines, Lam said, including an email and a text message service, and added manpower to troubleshoot issues. Residents could send their names and phone numbers to the email or their names to the text message service to receive help.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are confident with the new hotline we will be able to clear most of these outstanding [unactivated] cases,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Jasmine Siu</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Purchase the China AI Report 2020</span></a> brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).
