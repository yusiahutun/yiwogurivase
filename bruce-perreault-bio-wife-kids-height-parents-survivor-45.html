One particular participant from Survivor 44 also was brought along in the new season. Bruce Perreault was one of them. After being removed from the prior season early due to a head injury, he was asked to be back for the forty-fifth installment. In this, we shall therefore tell you all about him.</p><h3><strong>Bruce Perreault On Survivor 45</strong></h3><p>During Survivor 45, Bruce Perreault unfortunately met with a head injury. That in turn took him out of the game within 12 hours. He had something to prove as the oldest man in the competition during the first challenge. But, instead, he plunged head-first into a beam. The medics initially cleared him to continue with the game and later that night after he had severe head pain, he was medically evacuated. He was taken&nbsp;to a hospital in Fiji there after doing a CT scan they told him there was no brain bleed. And luckily after a week, Bruce felt better.</p><p>After the unfortunate ending, he got invited by Jeff Probst to compete again on the show. Bruce initially had no idea what to do. He even thought of ignoring it. However, when he came to know about the positive response he was receiving on the internet, he decided to just go.</p><p>So, that is the reason Bruce was getting the looks and nods from the new contestants. He found this kind of surreal and funny.</p><p>Lately, when talking to Entertainment Weekly, Bruce was asked if doing Survivor twice is either going to help or hurt him, he hinted confidently that he will give his 100 percent so that it only helps him. He was also hoping that his biggest superpowers 1) being a kryptonite and 2) ability to ask the proper questions just to get an answer should help him play the game.</p><h3><strong>Bruce Perreault Wife</strong></h3><p>Bruce’s wife is Melinda Duggan Perreault.

And also, she turned 50 years old in August 2022. When that happened, Bruce had taken to Facebook to call Melinda his rock, love, and soul. “Now, how the HELL did you deal with me. I am a handful and the world knows it!! But in all seriousness, I Love you and here is too another 50 years!!”, he also wrote after that.</p><p>Also, Bruce and his beloved and beautiful wife celebrated their 21st anniversary on 24 August 2023.
