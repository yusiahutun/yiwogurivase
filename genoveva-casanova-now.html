So&nbsp;<a href=#>where Genoveva Casanova</a>, Prince Frederik’s rumored mistress,&nbsp;is now the subject of much discussion as he and his wife, Princess Mary, are among the most beloved royals in Europe.</p><p>Crown&nbsp;<a href=#>Prince Frederik</a>&nbsp;of Denmark was born on 26 May 1968. He’s the eldest son of Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik and as such, is&nbsp;<a href=#>heir to the Danish throne</a>. In 2000, Frederik was in Australia for the 2000 Summer Olympics. He visited a pub with his brother Prince Joachim, his cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark, Princess Martha of Norway, and Prince of Asturias, Felipe VI — now the King of Spain.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/prince-frederik-princess-mary.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jake-gyllenhaal-neck-tattoo.jpg><p>Felipe VI had an Australian friend, and that friend invited her sister, who in turn invited her friend, who happened to be Mary’s housemate. He then invited Mary, a Tasmanian-born marketing consultant who was living in Sydney at the time. She initially had no idea&nbsp;<a href=#>of his royal status</a>, but it soon became apparent.</p><p>While they tried to keep a lid on their relationship, Frederik’s frequent trips to Australia began to rouse suspicion and soon, Danish tabloid Billed Bladet sent a journalist to Sydney to find out about Frederik’s “secret Australian girlfriend”. They broke the news abound the Prince’s relationship and described her as a&nbsp;“pretty, outgoing, gifted and perhaps future crown princess”.</p><p>She moved to Denmark in 2001 and by October 2003, they were engaged. Mary and Frederik were married on May 14, 2004, at Copenhagen Cathedral. In doing so, Mary became the first Australian to ever&nbsp;<a href=#>stand in line to be a queen</a>. The couple have four children – Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent, and Princess Josephine.</p><p>But in October, the beloved couple were rocked by a rumor of infidelity when photos emerged of Frederik and a socialite spending time together in Madrid. So who did Prince Frederik allegedly cheat on Mary with and <a href=#>where is Genoveva Casanova now</a>? Here’s what we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-genoveva-casanova-now>Where is Genoveva Casanova now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/prince-frederik-princess-mary-1.png><p>Where is Genoveva Casanova now? According to sources, she fled the Spanish capital and is holed up in San Sebastian to “disconnect” from public life.“ Her friends have told me that she is having&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>a very bad time of it</a>,” journalist Susanna Griso said on Espejo Público, per Sky News. “She is in hiding right now and has turned off her mobile phone because she doesn’t want anyone to call her.”</p><p>Casanova was born in Mexico but married into the Spanish aristocracy by wedding Duke Cayetano Martínez in 2005. They divorced in 2007 though they are thought to be on good terms.</p><p>On November 21, 2023, Casanova <a rel=nofollow href=#>broke her silence</a> but did not address the cheating rumors. Instead, she posted a tribute acknowledging the anniversary of her late mother-in-law, the Duchess of Alba’s death nine years ago at the age of 88. “I miss you so so much… your affection, your sense of humor, your so motherly way of caring and taking care of us, how I wish you never left,” she wrote. “Even though sometimes you still sit here next to me.&nbsp;You always loved me almost like another daughter, no matter what. Till the day you left you always held my hand. Thank you for your unconditional love.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The prince was photographed spending time with Casanova in October 2023. She has empathetically denied any romance between them and while the Danish royal family hasn’t commented publicly on the rumors, some royal followers believe Queen Margrethe’s abdication on December 31, 2023, is a response of sorts; an attempt to secure the future of the Danish royal family.</p><p>“The Queen always thought Mary was a fantastic asset to the royal family and if she thought she might leave it would have been a disaster,” British royal author Phil Dampier told the Daily Mail. “She will now hope that Frederik and Mary patch up any differences and work together as the new King and Queen.”</p><p>Indeed, Queen Margrethe’s abdication took many by surprise. “In two week’s time, I have been Queen of Denmark for 52 years,” she said in a statement. “Such an amount will leave its mark on anybody – also on me! The time takes its toll, and the number of ‘ailments’ increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past,” she added. “In February this year I underwent extensive back surgery,” she continued. &nbsp;</p><p>“Everything went well, thanks to the competent health personnel, who took care of me. Inevitably, the operation gave cause to thoughts about the future – whether now would be an appropriate time to pass on the responsibility to the next generation. “I have decided that now is the right time,” she said. “On 14th January 2024 – 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father – I will step down as Queen of Denmark. I will hand over the throne to my son Crown Prince Frederik.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
